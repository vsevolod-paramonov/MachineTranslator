when i was 11 years old , one morning i was hit by the sounds silly joy .
my father listened to his little , gray radio show the bbc program the bbc .
he looked very happy , which was quite unusual then , because it was the news was mostly .
he called , " the taliban are gone  ⁇  "
i didn 't know what that meant , but it obviously made my father was very , very happy .
" now you can go to a real school , " he said .
this morning , i will never will ever forget this morning .
a real school .
the taliban is the power in afghanistan when i was six , and banned girl to go to school .
so i fought for five years as a boy , and my older sister who had no longer be alone for a secret school .
only so we could both go to school .
every day we took another way , so nobody could guess where we went .
we hid our books in shopping bags so it looked like we 'd just walk shop .
we were taught in a house , over 100 girls in a little living room .
it was comfort , but in summer , it was incredibly hot .
we all knew that we risked our lives : teachers , students and our parents and our parents .
and again , the lesson suddenly had to fall for a week , because the taliban had suspicion .
we were never sure how much they knew about us .
were you google us ?
did you know where we live ?
we were scared , but we still wanted to go to school .
i 've been lucky in a family where education was important and daughters have been estimated .
my grandfather had been far ahead of his time .
an outsider from a remote province . he insisted , his daughter -- my mother -- to school , and was sent from his father .
but my educated mother was a teacher .
this is her .
two years ago , she was in retirement , just to transform our house to a school for girls and women from the neighborhood .
and my father -- to see here -- was the first one in his family who ever received a school education .
for him , it was always clear that his children would get education , even his daughters , despite the taliban , despite all the risks .
he looked at it as a much bigger risk to send his children not to school .
i still know that , in the years , sometimes under the taliban were so frustrated by our lives , fear and anxiety 's fear .
that i was feeling good , quit . but my dad said , " daughter , listen to me . you can lose everything in your life .
your money can be stolen . you can be displaced in the war from your house .
but one thing will always keep you : what 's in here , and even if we have to pay with our blood supply for your school fees , we will do that .
so -- you still want to give up ? "
today i am 22 years old .
i grew up in a country which has been destroyed by decades of war .
less than six percent of my age , women have higher education than the secondary school degree , and if my family didn 't care so much for my education , i would be one of these women .
instead , i 'm here today , as a proud of the mid-do college .
when i went to afghanistan , my grandfather , who was thrown by his family , because he managed to send his daughters to school , one of the first to me .
he 's not just with my graduate student , but also that i was the first woman and i 'm going to drive him with the car .
my family thinks about me .
i have big dreams , but my family has greater dreams for me .
so i 'm global ambassador for 10x10 , a global campaign for the education of women .
so i 've helped build solo , the first and perhaps the only boarding school for girls in afghanistan , a country where school school is still risky for girls .
it 's wonderful to see how the students at my school with great ambitious all of you want to perceive opportunities .
and seeing how their parents and fathers once again ask them , as my parents , for me , despite all against all the transcripts .
like ahmed . that 's not his real name , and i can 't show his face , but ahmed is the father 's one of my students .
just a month ago , his daughter and he was on the way home in her village , and they 're the death by a bomb on the side of a few minutes ago .
when he got home , the phone rings and a voice told him if he sent his daughter on to school , they would try again .
and he said , " kill me now , if you want to do , but i 'm not going to put the future of my daughter because of your age-known and present ideas . "
what afghanistan , so i recognized something that will often be dismissed in the west : behind most of us who succeed , there 's a father who recognizes the value of his daughter and the fact that your success is also success .
that 's not to say that our mothers don 't matter important role in our success .
in fact , they 're often the ones who confront themselves and persuasive for a promising future of their daughters , but in a society like afghanistan is essential for the support of men .
under the taliban , just a few hundred girls to school -- because it was illegal .
but today , in afghanistan over three million girls who bank school bank .
afghanistan appears from america , looks so different .
the americans recognize how uncertain changes are .
i 'm afraid that the changes are not long and changes with the trigger of the u.s. troops changes everything .
but when i 'm in afghanistan , when i see the students in my school , and their parents who care about them , i see a promising future and a long-scale change .
afghanistan for me , a country of hope and the unlimited possibilities , and remember every day , the girls who go to the soles .
just like i have big dreams .
thank you .
all i do , including my life -- my life -- was being shaped by seven years of work in africa as young man .
from 19 ⁇ 1 to 19 ⁇  -- i look young , but it 's not -- -- i 've been in zambia , kenya , cote d ⁇  , algeria and somalia and somalia on projects of technical working with african countries .
i worked for a italian ngo , and every single project that we put on the legs , failed .
i was desperate .
i , 21 years , i thought that we are good people and good work done in africa .
instead , we killed everything we did .
our first project , which my first book was inspired by the zambles of the zaffil , was one where we wanted to show italian people sam 's offices how to become food .
we came up with italy seed seeds in southern germany ; in this stunning valley , which leads to sam di , and we taught the population of local communities and also toc andc ⁇  ...
of course , the local absolutely no interest in this , so we paid them working for this , and sometimes they came up .
we were amazed that there was no agricultural valley in such a fertile agricultural valley .
but instead of asking , why they didn 't grow up , we simply said , " thank god that we are here  ⁇  "
" just in time to save people sam 's from killing the starvation . "
of course all of all wonderful things in africa .
we had this magnificent tomato . in italy , they became so large , in zambia so large .
we couldn 't believe it , and we said , " look how easy agriculture is . "
when the tomato were ripe and red , over night , about 200 feet from the river and everything came out .
we said to the sambb : " oh god , the nile  ⁇  "
and they said , " yes , so we don 't have agriculture here . "
" why didn 't you say that ? " you never asked us . "
i just thought we were so great in africa , but then i saw what the americans did , what the french did , what the french did . after i saw what they did , i was pretty proud of our project .
we were at least , at least the nile .
you should see the nonsense -- -- you should see the nonsense that we haven 't given the leading african people wasted .
you should read the book , " dead aid " by da vinci , she 's a sam pot economic growth .
the book was published in 2009 .
we 've been covering the african continent has given 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years .
i 'm not going to tell you what this money has been doing .
just read your book .
read from an africanin , which we have .
we are western people are empires , colonialists , mission , and there are only two ways that we deal with people . we pat them or we 're patriarchal .
both words come from the latin root " father , " what " father means . "
but they have two different meanings .
patriarchalal : i 'm acting every other culture as if they were my children . " i love you so much . "
patis : i 'm holding every other culture as if you were my servant .
so white people in africa are called " bana , " boss , called .
i became a wake , when i read the book , " small , " written by schum , " he said , especially in economics , if people don 't want help , let them calm down .
this should be the first principle of help .
the first principle of help is respect .
this morning , the gentleman was opening up this conference , put a pole on the ground and said , " can you imagine a city that 's not neo-up ? "
when i was 2 ⁇  years old , i decided to respond only to people , and i invented a system called company companies , where never will ever get anything , but you become a service of local labor , the servant of the local people who have a better person .
what you do -- you hold your mouth .
you never get a community of ideas with ideas , you sit with the local people .
we don 't work from offices .
we meet ourselves in cafes . we meet in bars .
we don 't have infrastructure .
we close friendships and find out what the person wants to do .
the most important is passion .
you can give someone an idea .
if this person doesn 't like this , what do you do ?
the passion for your own growth of the person is the most important .
the passion for its own growing is the most important of humanity .
we help them find the knowledge because nobody can be successful alone .
the person with the idea may not knowing that , but it 's available .
many years ago , i had this statement : why , instead of coming to a community and telling people what to do , why don 't we hear them ? but not in a community .
let me tell you a secret .
there 's a problem with a community mindset .
entrepreneurs never have any part , and you 'll never say publicly to say what you want to do with your money , what choices you see .
planning has this blind spot .
the smartest people of the community don 't know because they never appear to meet public .
we 're working on one to do this , needs to be created a social infrastructure that doesn 't exist .
a new job has to be created .
this is the doctor 's house of the company , the house of the engaging with them in the house , sitting on your kitchen table and in the cafe , helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a way to transform life .
i 've tried this in it , western australia , tried .
i worked at the time and i tried to kick out the falling apart , where we tell others what to do to escape .
i helped these five fishermen to work together and to sell this wonderful tuna not to a factory in albany 60 cents , but for japan , for 15 dollars , and then the farmers came to me and said , " hey , do you help us . "
in one year , i had 2 ⁇  projects . the government came to ask me , " how do you do this ?
how do you do ... " i said , " i do something very , very difficult .
i keep your mouth and i hear you . "
so -- -- so the government says , " do it again . "
we 've done it all over the world in 300 communities .
we 've helped 100,000 companies in creating department .
there 's a new generation of companies thrown into loneliness .
peter printer , one of the best corporate support story , died with 96 years ago .
peter printer was philosophy professor , before he was involved with business . peter printer said , planning is really incompatible with an entrepreneur of entrepreneurs and economics . "
planning is the ancestor of the entrepreneur of the entrepreneurial spirit .
so , you build christchurch to create without knowing what the smartest human christchurch will want to do with their money and their energy .
you have to learn how to get this is bringing you to come up on you .
you have to give them private and privacy . you have to be great to help them , and they 'll come in .
in a community of 10,000 people , we get 200 customers .
can you imagine a community of 400 people , intelligence and passion ?
what presentation are you most cheer this morning ?
local , passionate people . these have them embrace it .
i want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way .
we 're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- it 's not sustainable fossil fuels , manufacturing -- and suddenly there are systems that aren 't sustainable .
the final machine is not sustainable .
the cheeky-artable is not sustainable .
we need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable way , heal , transport , transport , and they can transport them .
the technologies don 't exist .
who 's going to invent this technology for the green revolution ? universities ? forget it  ⁇ 
the government ? forget 's it  ⁇ 
it 'll be entrepreneurs . and you 're doing it already .
i read a beautiful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago .
there was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of new york city in 1860 year in 1865 .
in 1860 , they came together and spared , which would happen in 100 years with the new york city , and the implication was unity : the new york city would not exist in 100 years .
why ? they looked at the curve , and they said , if the population grows in that speed , they needed six million horses to get the people , and it would be impossible to deal with the crap of six million horses .
because they went in shit .
in 18600 , you see the dirty technology that lives life from new york .
what happens ? 40 years later , 1900 , in the united states , there were 1001 million car -- 1001 .
the idea of finding another technology , had done the race . there were little factories in the wet .
de acorn , michigan . henry ford .
there 's a secret to work with entrepreneurs .
first of all , you have to be a accountable .
otherwise they don 't come and talk to them .
next you have to give them absolute , dedicated and passionate service service .
then you have to tell you the absolute truth about entrepreneurship .
from the smallest until the biggest company , all need to be able to perform three things : to sell the product needs to be grand , the market needs to be grand and the financial textbook must be massive .
guess what ?
we 've never met a single person who can produce sell at the same time , sell and care about the money .
that doesn 't exist .
this person was never was born .
we 've done research , and we looked at the 100 iconic companies in the world -- carnegie , west , west africa , the new companies , google companies , yahoo , yahoo .
there 's only one thing that all successful companies in the world , only one : no one was founded by only one person .
now we teach 16-year-old in north korea entrepreneurship , and we start teaching them to give you the first two sides of richard branson , and the task of 16-year-old , it 's in the first two sides of richard koshure , how often he used the word , "
never " i " and 32 times " we . "
he wasn 't alone when he started .
nobody started a company alone . nobody .
so we can create a community in which facilitator who have a small entrepreneur in cafes , sit in cafes and bars -- their dedicated buddy who are going to do for you , what anybody else has done for this gentleman who 's talking about this epic . somebody who will say , " what you need ? "
what can you do ? can you make it ?
okay , can you sell it ? can you pay the money ? "
" oh , no , i can 't . " " you want me to find somebody for you ? "
we activate communities .
we have groups of volunteers who are supporting companies to help them find the resources and people , and we 've found that the wonder of the local citizens of the local population , that the culture and the economy of this community can be transformed by simply the passion and energy of their imagination .
thank you .
five years ago , i have learned how it must be , to be alice in wonderland .
the penn state university he asked me -- a dodecahedron for communication -- it 's education in communication to communicate .
i was scared --
real fear . fear of these students with their big brains and their big books and their great books , i don 't trusted words .
but when the conversation developed , it struck me like alice , when she can go down to the guinea and saw a door to a whole new world .
just as i felt like talking to the students with the students , and i was amazed about the thoughts they had and wanted others to discover this miracle .
i think to open this door , it needs great communication .
we really need great communication of our scientists and engineers to change the world .
because our scientists and engineers are the ones who are our biggest problems , like energy , environmental and health , and when we don 't know about it and it 's not going , i think it 's in our responsibility as non- scientist , this conversation .
but these amazing conversations don 't come from when our scientists and engineers don 't invite us in their wonderland .
so scientists and engineers , please , please stand up .
i want to show you a couple of approaches how you can do it , that we can see that science and technology that you 're busy doing , sexy and exciting .
the first question you need to answer is : well ?
tell us why your scientific area is so relevant to us .
not only does it tell us that you 're looking at usage , but also tells us that their trapezones , which is in our bones , because it 's important to understand osteoporosis and treat osteopor .
and if you describes what you do , then you 'll agree with a technical term .
technical term is a obstacle to understanding of your thoughts .
surely you could use it and time and time , but why don 't you just say  ⁇  space and time , " what is much more useful for us ?
to make our minds from your mind is not the same as you 're rolling down .
as einstein said , " do things just as simple as possible -- but not simpler . "
you can tell us something about your scientific area , without having to impose tradeoffs .
some of the things are too much about this : examples , examples , stories and analogies . in this way , you can pull us in your spell .
and if you presented your work , then let the points away .
have you ever wondered why it 's called " point ? "
what happens when someone comes out ? another one 's going to sentence , and with these dots first you tell your audience .
one slide like this is not just boring , but also turns too much on the language part of our brain , and by doing so quickly .
this example of genes of genes is much more potent . it shows that the special structure of the trapezier is so stable that it was even the inspiration for the unique design of the eiffel tower .
the trick here is to use a single , easy reading , just to use the audience where the audience once it loses the thread .
these are just a couple of approaches that can help us open up this door and see the miracle that science and technology and the technology in itself .
since the engineers i 've taught me to have taught me to make with the " nerd in me , i want to summarize everything with an equation .
pulls your science closer and close your subject to your subject , divide that by the relevance , so the audience , which is important , and multiply the whole thing with passion you have for your incredible work : and that 's how crowded new insights are full .
so scientists and engineers , if you 've solved this equation , it 's necessarily me .
thank you .
hi . this is my phone .
a cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom .
with a cell phone , you can film a crime in humanity in syria .
with a cell phone , you can tweet a message and a protest in egypt .
and with a mobile phone , you can record a song , upload it at sound and famous and famous .
all this is possible with a mobile phone .
i 'm in 1984 and live in berlin .
let 's go back in those days .
you can see how hundreds of thousands of people went to the street and demonstrated .
we are in the fall of 1989 , and imagine that all of these people who were agreed and changing changes , had a cell phone in your pocket .
who in the room has a cell phone ?
hold it up .
keep your cell phones up , hold them up  ⁇ 
hold it up . a android , a blackberry , wow .
these are a lot . almost everybody has a cell phone today .
but today , i want to talk about me and my phone and how it changed my life .
and i 'm going to talk about this .
these are 358 e8 e8 information .
raw .
and why is this information there ?
because in the summer of 2006 , the e.u.u.u.u.u.u. has a policy .
this policy is called the policy data storage system .
this policy is saying that every telephone society in europe , every internet service providers in europe , has to store a bandwidth of user information .
who calls who ? who 's calling an email ?
who puts a text ?
and if you use a cell phone where you are .
all of this information is stored for at least six months to two years from your telephone company or your internet service providers .
and everywhere in europe , people got up and said , " we don 't want it . "
they said , we don 't want to put this data storage data storage .
we don 't want to self-determination in the digital age , and we don 't want the telephone companies and internet service providers all this information about us .
there were lawyers , journalists , priests , priests , everybody said , " we don 't want it . "
and here you can see how tens of thousands of people flocked to the streets of berlin and said , " freedom instead of fear . "
and some even said , this could be 2.0 2.0 .
the stasis was the grassroots police in eastern germany .
and i 'm also wonder whether this really works .
can they really can store all this information about us ?
every time i use my phone ?
so i asked my phone company , the german factory , which was the largest telephone company in germany , and i asked her , please send me all the information you 've stored over me .
and i asked her once and i asked her again , and she didn 't get the right answer . except empty blah blah blah .
but then i said , i want to have this information , because it 's my life that you 're going to be there .
so i decided to launch a court countering them , because i wanted this information .
but the german gombs , no , we 're not going to give you this information .
at the end , it came to a comparison with you .
i 'm going back the charges , what they would send me all the information .
because in the meanwhile , the federal budget decided that the introduction of e.u.u.u.u. was right into german law .
so i got this ugly brown jin with a cd .
and on the cd was this .
358 e8 lines of information .
first of all , i saw it , and i said to me , well , it 's a huge file . my job .
but then i realized after a while , this is my life .
this is six months of my life in this file .
so i was a little bit skeptical , what should i start with it ?
because you see where i am , where i sleep at night , what i do .
but then i told myself , i want to go to the public information .
i want to make you publication .
because i want to show people what 's happening in the supply data storage system .
so over time and open data city , i did this .
this is a visualization of six months of my life .
you can zoom in and pull out , you can rewind it , you can rewind it and forth .
you can take every step i do , you can track .
and you can even see how i 'm going to go from frankfali with the train crash , and how many calls i do the way out .
all of this is possible with this information .
this makes a little bit scared .
but it 's not just me .
it 's all of us .
it 's just like , i call my wife , and she calls me , and we 're talking a few times .
and then some friends call me and they call each other .
and after a while they call them , and they call it , and we have this huge communications network network .
but you can see how people communicate with each other , what times they call each other when they go to bed .
you can see it all .
you see the central figures , about who are the leaders of the group .
if you have access to that information , you can see what society makes you do .
if you have access to that information , you can control society .
this is a blueprint for countries like china and iran .
this is the perfect design of how to monitor a society , because you know who talks to who sends an email , all that 's possible if you have access to this information .
and that information is stored for at least six months in europe to two years .
as i said at the beginning , we imagine that all these people in the streets in berlin , in the fall of the fall cell phones in their pocket cell .
and the authorities would have known who was at the demonstration , and if the authorities had been who the leaders were , it might never happened .
the case of the berlin wall may not occurred .
and then it 's not the case of the iron curtain .
because today , government agencies and companies want to store so many information as they can get over us , online and offline .
they want to have the opportunity to pursue our lives , and they want it to store everything long .
but self-determination and life in digital age are not a contradiction .
however , you have to fight for your signature today .
you have to fight every day .
so when you go home , tell your friends that privacy is a 21st century , and this is not old .
if you go home , say your deputy , just because companies and national places have the opportunity to store specific information , you don 't have to do it long yet .
and if you don 't believe me , you ask your telephone company after the information you 've stored over you .
so , in the future , every time you use your cell phone , remember that you have to fight the policies in the digital age .
thank you .
i live in south central .
that 's south central : east editor , restaurants fast , restaurants , collapsed .
so the urban planners come and they started to change the name of central central to something else , so it changed it in south los angeles as if that changes something about what 's wrong in the city .
this is south los angeles .
in the name means , quickly , restaurants , break , collapsed .
as 26.5 million other americans live in the food desert in central london , the home of the drive-us and the board .
the weird thing is that the rise of double-us more people than the drive-to-day .
people die in south central los angeles of healing disease .
for example , the obesity rate in my neighborhood , for five times higher than about beverly hills , which is about 15 miles away .
i couldn 't see that anymore .
and i wondered how you would feel if they didn 't have access to healthy food , if you go out of the house , the negative effects that has the existing food system on your neighborhood .
i 'm enlightened , that wheelchairs are bought and sold like trans-throughers .
i see dialysis centers like starbucks shoot like starbucks .
and i realized that must stop .
i announced the problem is the solution .
food is the problem and food is the solution .
and i also had no more comfortable on 45-minute trip to get an apple that 's not with pesticides .
so i was planting a food from my house .
it 's a piece of land that we call park park park .
it 's 45 feet .
the thing is , it 's the city .
but you have to care .
so i think , " cool . i can do what i want , because it 's my responsibility and i have to hold it in stand . "
and i decided to keep it was like this .
so i came and my group , l.a. green ground , together , and we started to get my food forest , and fruit trees , to plant the whole program , vegetables .
we 're a kind of a binary group , composed of gardening of all social strata , and from all the city , it 's completely voluntary and everything we do is free .
and the garden is beautiful .
but then someone complained .
the city came up to me , and he basically took me a charge , and he said that i have to remove my garden , which became a judge .
and i thought , " is it 's real ?
a judge forer out of growing food on a piece of land that doesn 't matter ? "
and i thought , " cool . here . "
because this time it wouldn 't go .
the l.a. times got wind of it . steve lz did a story about it , and talked to the city council , and with a member of green ground , and she handed down a petition for a.org.org and 900 below , we succeeded .
we kept the victory in the hands .
my city council even called and said they support it and love what we do .
so really , why shouldn 't you do that ?
l.a. in the united states , most of the lines have collapsed in the city .
they have 6 ⁇  kilometers of carbon sink .
these are 20 central park .
this is enough land enough to plant  ⁇ 2 million tomato plants plants .
why the hell should you not find that ok ?
you get 1,000 seeds of a plant , you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seed seeds .
with green beans in value of a dollar , you get fruit and vegetables worth of  ⁇ 5 dollars .
it 's my savior operation , i 'm telling people to grow their own food .
its own food is how to print your own money .
see , i have a legacy in south central .
i grew up there . i raised my sons there .
and i refuse to be part of this preconceived reality that was made by other people , and i make my own reality .
see , i 'm an artist .
garden is my mom 's my graffiti . i ' i plant my artwork .
just like a graffiti artist , the walls , i 'm cutting lawns and park .
i use the garden , the earth , like a piece of stuff , and the plants and the trees are my hunting for these cloth .
you would be surprised what the soil can do when you use it as a canvas .
you can 't imagine how amazing an sunflower is , and how they touch people .
so what happened ?
i 've experienced how my garden became an instrument for education and the transformation of my neighborhood .
to change the community , you have to change the composition of the soil .
we are the ground .
you would wonder how children are influenced by how children are affected .
gardening , the therapeutic and most audacious act you can do , especially in the middle of the city .
furthermore , you get strawberries .
i remember this time when this mother and her daughter came , it was about 10 : 30 night . they were in my garden , and i came out and i looked at them and they were so embarrassed .
i really felt really bad because they were there , and i told them , " you know , you don 't have to do that .
the garden is not without the reason on the street . "
i 've been busy watching when i saw people who were so close to me and were hungry , and that just got me in doing that . people said , " fin , you have no fear that people are going to steal your food . "
and i said , " to the devil , no , i 'm not afraid they 're claws .
and it 's on the street .
this is the idea .
i want you to take it , but at the same time i want you to take your health . "
at another time , i put a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown l.a.a .
these are the guys who helped me have helped drive the truck truck .
it was cool , and they shared their stories about how it affects them and how she was interacting with her mother and her grandmother , and it was great to see how it changed when it might just for a moment .
green ground has planted about 20 gardens of gardens .
so 50 people came to our inclusion agenda , so 50 people and did it , and these are all volunteers .
when children were kids , kids eat children , kids were kids .
if you grow tomatoes , you eat tomatoes .
but if you don 't offered anything about it if you didn 't show them , like eating and body 's body , you 're blind , whatever you eat them .
i see young people who want to work , but they 're stuck in this thing -- i see colored children who are right on the path that 's intended for them , and that doesn 't lead them nowhere .
the gardening , i see as an opportunity where we can train these children to take care of their communities to lead a sustainable life .
and if we do that , who knows ?
we could make the next george washington carver carver .
but if we don 't change the composition of the ground , we 'll never will .
so this is one of my plans . i want to do that .
i want to plant a whole block of gardens of gardens where people can share the food in the same block .
i want to take a shipon and turn them into healthy cafe .
so , don 't get me wrong .
i 'm not talking about free , because free is unsustainable .
the funny thing about sustainability is you have to stay through it .
i 'm talking about giving people work and bring children from the streets , and to bring them the joy , pride and the honor to experience when you open your own food , and when you open farmers .
so what i want to do here is to do this sexy .
i want us to become all the environmental rebels , gait , gait , gear .
we need to turn the picture of gang star .
if you 're not a gardeners , you 're not a gangster .
gangster is , you 're going to be a nerdy shovel , right ?
and let the weapon of your choice will be .
if you want to meet with me , don 't call me if you want to sit in your chairs and want to do a meeting where you 're talking about making fun .
if you want to meet me , come with your shovels , in my backyard , so we can make any plants .
peace . thank you .
thank you .
one of my favorite dictionary in the whole oxford english dictionary is " snuggly rensucks . "
because it sounds beautiful .
and " snuggish " means " a dishonest political politician . "
although a newspaper on the 19th century , a newspaper on a better definition , " a snobserved is someone who 's a practice , independently of party , program or a conductive , and its success through the strength of monument to the monument of the monument was achieved . "
i have no idea what 's " language . "
something in words , i think .
but it 's very important that words at the center of politics , and all politicians know that they have to try to control language .
in 1 ⁇ 1 ⁇ 1 , for example , according to the british parliament , newspapers , not the exact word of the debates of the debates .
and that actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary names of muhammad called the parliamentary department .
they threw him in the tower of london and he was , but he was brave enough , he was brave enough , he was brave enough , and finally he had so much support in london he won .
and just a few years later , we find the first test for the sentence as strong as bri . many believe .
it 's on the english word for metal .
but that 's not true . it goes back to a advocate of press freedom of freedom .
but to show you how words and policy makers are , i want to take you to the united states , at the time when she 's reached independence .
you looked at the question of how to ask george washington , the head of state , call the head of state .
you didn 't know .
how do you call the leader of a republican nation ?
this has been edited long run in congress .
and there was all sorts of different suggestions .
i mean , some people wanted to call him governor washington , and others , his majesty george washington , and again , others , foreign minister of freedom of the united states of america .
not so memorable .
some people just wanted to call him king .
they thought it was fake-aden .
they weren 't monistic , they wanted the king to choose a certain amount of time .
it could have worked .
but everyone was a fair bored because this debate was 3 weeks .
i 've read the diary of a senator reading , who is constantly writing : " still the same theme . "
the reason for the delay , and the boredom was that the representatives was against the senate .
the representatives of representatives didn 't want washington is going to be power . they didn 't want it .
king call , and he might even put it to ideas to its results .
they wanted to give him the most precious , most sophisticated , the most pathetic title that they could think .
this title was president was president .
president . they didn 't invented the title . he existed before , but he only meant that somebody was in a meeting .
something like the front of a jury .
he didn 't have more size than the term " on " or " in the bioter . "
sometimes there was a little bit of a native americans and government groups , but it was a rather trivial title .
so the senate refused to stop .
they said , " this is ridiculous , you can 't call him president .
this guy has to sign and they would meet foreign block .
who 's going to take it seriously , if he 's got a stupid little titles like president of america 's united states of america ? "
and after three weeks , the senate didn 't go to the senate .
you can learn three interesting things .
first of all -- and that 's the best -- until now i can 't figure out if the senate has ever opened up the president said .
barack obama , president obama , has just borrowed the title , he just waiting for the senate is active .
second , you can learn that if a government says that something is temporary -- -- you wait 223 years later .
third , and that 's really important , that 's the most important point is that the president of the united states of america today doesn 't sound so sinister , right ?
this has to do with something more than 5,000 nuclear warheads that he has and the largest economy of the world and a fleet of fleet and this whole stuff .
reality and history gave the title have given size .
and so the senate has won the senate at the end .
you got an respect title .
and the other concern of the senate , which seems to seem to be familiar -- well , back then it was like that .
but you know how many nations have a president ?
14 ⁇  .
because they want to sound like the guy with the 5,000 nuclear warheads , etc .
so at the end of the senate , and the kansas house lost , because no one feels like when you 're told that you 're now the president of america 's united states .
and that 's the most important thing you can take , and i 'm going to leave .
politicians try to use words to shape the reality and control reality , but in fact , the reality is much more than words could ever change reality .
thank you .
so i came to a truck with about 50 rebels in fighting around dourtalite -- a 19-year-old , vegetarian of jacksonville , florida .
i covered my black bear in half- galaxy against a few brown leather bag of sand and fire was a rocket towards the government department that i couldn 't even see .
this was the first time i was in afghanistan .
for a long time before i 've grown up with the war , but next to pythagoras and footballers and football games on sam potions and squeeze with racist-to-child and religious scholars , who lived  ⁇  unclear  ⁇  with communism and afghanistan long ago , and i knew what we did .
but that 's the geography of self .
and so i 'm standing here , educated afghan , south-states of god , an atheist , an atheist who lived in afghanistan for the last nine years and created .
so , there 's a lot of great things that you could do art , but i personally don 't like rain . i want to make art that personalities and challenges the personalities and challenge and engage in the reality and the reality that even uses a kind of fantasy , to try to try to define the world .
i want to spend a day in the life of a jihad , who uses his jihad against communistists like " pop star wars " and the religious practices and political corruption to enrich himself .
and what else can the jihad do the jihad than to run for parliament and make a choice campaign with the slogan : " vote me  ⁇  i do jihad and i 'm rich . "
and try to use this campaign to take this mafiusai gorge that spend as national pride .
i want to go to corruption in afghanistan on the bottom , with a project called " back-up , " where you 're a police officer , a false control on the streets of kabul and cars , but instead of giving them to take money , and give you money , and in the name of kabul .
i want to look at how conflict in afghanistan , in my opinion has become the fashionable conflict .
the war and the stranger views that came with him , have created a new environment for stans and fashion that you can only capture by creating a fashion factory for military troops and suicide bombers in which i 'm going to get rid of a shelter with a coast of shelter or a couple of shelter in a row or a row in a row , if you 's.s.s.d.
and i 'd like to see how a simple push from kabul , between 1899 looks like 1899 , to create a dialogue about how today 's development , their roots come back into the past  ⁇  unclear  ⁇  the man 's man , " to protect the brown man themselves .
but for all of these things you can come to jail , they can be misunderstood , more misinformation .
but i do it because i have to , because the geography of self requires it .
that 's my burden . what is your ?
thank you .
hi . my name is cameron russell , and for a while i 've been working as a model .
for 10 years , exactly said .
i feel that now , in the room , there 's an unfortunate tension tension , because i shouldn 't have put this dress .
fortunately , i 've got a little bit to change .
so this is the first time someone on the ted stage , so you can appreciate that , i think .
if a couple of women were really startled when i came out , you don 't need to tell me now that i read later on twitter .
i also realize that i 'm pretty privileged , because i can change in very short 10 seconds , which you think of me .
not everyone has the chance .
these absences are very uncomfortable , it 's good that i didn 't want to wear them anyway .
the hardest part is to draw the sweater about my head , because then you 'll all bite me , so you don 't do anything until it 's over my head .
all right .
why did i do that now ?
that was embarrassing .
well , it was hopefully not as embarrassing as this picture .
a image is powerful , but a image is also a image is superficial .
i 've just changed your opinion in six seconds ago .
and on this picture -- i really had never had a friend .
i felt very uncomfortable , and the photographer told me i should have my back and with my hand into the hair 's hair .
and apart from surgery or the wrongness , which i 'm imagining two days ago for work , there 's very few opportunities to change our interests , and our external factors -- although it 's crude and untested -- a huge impact on our lives .
fearless to be to me , to be honest today .
and i stand on this stage because i 'm a model .
i stand on this stage because i 'm a lovely white woman , and in my business , we call this a sexy girl .
i 'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but the honest way .
the first question is , " how will you become a model ? "
i always say , " oh , i was discovered , " but that doesn 't mean anything .
the real reason i became a model is an asset in the genetic lottery and an important heritage and maybe you wonder what this legacy is .
well , in the last few centuries , we have beauty not only as healthy and young and confident that we 're programmed biologically , but also as big , common and bright and bright .
this legacy was created for me . and it 's a legacy that 's for me .
i know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point , and maybe some fashion designers call out , " stop . watch , tyler . yo .
and first of all , i 'll come to your model model . very impressive .
but unfortunately , i have to tell you that in 200 ⁇  , a very ambitious graduate student of nyu all models on the runway , every single one that was turned out , and that of 6 ⁇  , only 2 ⁇  or less than four percent .
the next question i 'm always asked , " can i become a model if i grow up ? "
and first i say , " i don 't know , that 's not in my responsibility . "
but the second answer i really want to give this little girl is , " why ?
you know what ? you can become everything .
you can become the president of the u.s. or the inventor of the next internet or a ninja-and-hakes , which would be completely insane , because then you were the first one . "
if you still say to this great line , you say , " no , no , no , i want to become a model , " i 'll say , " my boss . "
because i don 't have a responsibility for nothing , and you could be the editor of american bird 's or the ceo of h  ⁇  m  ⁇  m or the next one of steven .
to say later , you want to become a model , is like you 're going to say that you want to win the jacks in the lottery .
you can 't influence it , and it 's fantastic , and it 's not a career path .
now , i want to demonstrate you 10 years of visual model , because unlike heart surgeons , it 's just a moment now .
it looks something like this .
hopefully less than that in the middle .
that was -- i don 't know what happened .
if you finished school and you 've done a resume and you 've done some jobs , unfortunately you can 't say much more . if you say you want to be a president of the united states , but in the r ⁇  , " 10 years old , " you 'll be funny .
the next question i 'm often asked is , " are all of the photographs ? "
and yes , pretty much all the photographs will be re-made , but that 's just a small part of what 's happening .
this is the very first picture i did , and that was the very first time i wore a bikini , and i didn 't even had my period .
i know this is going to be quite personally , but i was a young girl .
this is what i just looked like a few months earlier , with my grandmother .
that 's me the day of this shoot date .
my friend had to come to me .
that 's me on a pajama party , a few days ago in front of a french academy for the french bird .
this is me with the football team and in v- magazine .
and this is me today .
and i hope you can see these images are not pictures of me .
it 's constructed , and it 's constructed by a group of professionals , from haifers and makeupers and photographers and photographers , and all of their assistants and post-production and production . they don 't do that .
okay , the next thing people always ask me , " do you get stuff for nothing ? "
yeah , i 've got too many 20-inch shoes that i can never wear , except , but the things that i get free are things that i get in real life and talk about it .
i grew up in cambridge , and one day i went to a shop , and i had forgotten my money , and you gave me the dress for free .
as a teenager , i went to my friend with , a terrible driver , and she traveled across a red traffic light , and of course we turned down . it only took one : " sorry , mr. doctor , " and already we could continue .
i got these free things about my look and not because of my personality , and there are people who look like their appearance and not because of their personality 's personality .
i live in new york , and from 140 teenagers who have been stopped last year , were 85 percent black and latino and latino men and most young men .
it lives in new york just 1 ⁇ ,000 young , male and male and latino people who don 't ask the question : " am i going to be stopped ? "
but , " how many times am i 'm going to be stopped ? when am i stopped ? "
in my research for this talk , i found that 53 percent of all the 13-year-old girls in the united states don 't like their body , and that number goes up to  ⁇ 8 percent when they have become 1 ⁇  percent .
the last question to me is , " how is it being a model ? "
and i think you 're expecting this answer : " if you 're a little thinner and shine hair , you feel very happy and fabulous . "
and then we give you an answer that might give this impression .
we say , " it 's really great to travel so much , and it 's great to work with creative , inspired , inspired people . "
it 's true , but it 's just half of the story , because what we never tell before the camera that i 've never said before the camera is , " i feel unsure . "
and i feel unsure because i have to think about my look every day .
and if you ever wondered , " would i happier if i had thin legs and shine hair ? "
and then you should meet some models , because they have the thin legs and the shiny hair and the coolest clothes , and they 're the ones because of their appearance are probably the most insecure women on the planet .
when i prepared this talk , it seemed very hard to draw an honest balance , because on one hand , i felt very uncomfortable to sit down here and say , " i got all the advantages from a pile that became my mind . " and it doesn 't feel very well to me to do that . "
it was very difficult , especially a legacy of oppression because of gender and race , when i 'm one of the greatest benefit from it .
if you take something from this talk , i hope that we all recognize the power of the image in our alleged and failures are more likely to realize .
thank you .
i never forgot the words of my grandmother 's words that 's ever life in exile : " son , the most sauropaths . wake him .
but never will never become something like a gaddafi legacy revolution . "
it 's been almost two years since the libyan revolution has been inspired by the waves of mass extinctions both in the tunisian revolution and in egyptian revolution .
i 'm dealing with a lot of other libyan people , and beyond the libyan regime to launch a day of anger and to launch a revolution against the tyrann regime of gisland .
and there she was , a big revolution .
boy , women and men and men were standing in the first row , the end of the regime , sleds the freedom of liberty , dignity of freedom , and social justice into the air .
they have proved an example of courage by asking for the brutal dictatorship legislation gave us .
they have shown a strong sense of solidarity , from the far east over the far west , up to the south .
finally , after six months of violent war and almost 50,000 deaths , it allowed us to free our country and to pump the tyrants .
however , there 's a large burden of legacy , a legacy of tyranny , the corruption and foundation for speed .
over four decades , we 've been giving away from the infrastructure , both the infrastructure and culture and moral structure of the moral society .
the devastation and the challenges of the challenges , i burned , like so many other women to rebuild civil society , and we asked a myth and righteous transition to democracy and national happiness .
nearly 200 organizations have been formed during and immediately after the case of gaddafi in benkhau , created nearly 300 in triassic .
after 33 years in exile , i came back to libya , and with unique enthusiasm , i started workshops on issues of human development and leadership development .
with a wonderful group of women , i founded the peace platform of women , a movement of women , leaders from different lives , whose goal is to stand to the violence of women , and for our right to the order of democracy and education .
in front of elections , i met on a very difficult environment , a environment that always comes more polarized . a environment that was shaped by the selfish policy and exclusion .
i ran an initiative of peace talks to protect women 's freedom to achieve an excuse to achieve a rule of choice , a law that every citizen , no matter what the background should be right to vote and run in front of all to political parties , and to fight for political parties on the front of women and a contest on the front of different times , and a male sex and a different times ,
at the end , our initiative was taken and successfully .
women won 1 ⁇ .5 percent of the national congress in the first election for 52 years .
but slowly , surely the euphoria of elections , and the entire revolution , because every day we wake up to new news of violence .
one morning , we would crush into the mel gibbergs and sufi masters .
on another morning , we got news about the murder of the american ambassador and attacking the message .
another morning , the signature 's signature was reported by the army of the army .
and really every day , we get under the authority of milges and their ongoing resistance against human rights and their miss rules and laws of rules and laws .
our society , shaped by a revolution in mind , polarized and distant from the ideal and principles , the social justice , social justice  ⁇  that she first started .
intolerance , out of exclusion and revenge became the icons of the revolution .
i 'm not there today to inspire them with the success story of our fangs and the elections .
in fact , i 'm here today to confess that as a nation , the wrong choice and the wrong decisions .
we set up our priorities wrong .
because elections didn 't bring peace nor stability or security in lydia .
has the one-and-and-time list and the interplay between female and male candidate peace and national reconciliation ?
no , that didn 't .
what is it then ?
why is our society continues to continue to polarizes and dominated by selfish politics of dominance and the dominance , both from men and women ?
maybe the women weren 't the only thing to have , but the female values of compassion , the grace , the grace and the fallacy .
our society needs a national dialogue and consensus than it took the elections that ended up the polarization and rehabilitization .
our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female embodiment more than it takes the numerical , quantitative embodiment of female .
we need to stop acting in the name of anger and ask a day of revenge .
we need to start in the name of compassion and the grace is about act .
we need to develop a female discourse that doesn 't just pick the following values , but also , instead of revenge instead of revenge , instead of competition instead of competition , instead of exclusionary .
these are the ideals that takes a war of war-made man-made needs to reach peace .
because the peace has a whole building , and in this alga , it 's about the feminine and masquerors of the feminist and masquerque points .
this is the real estate one .
and we need to implement that we need to make existential futility before we do it socialization .
after a verse from the quran " salam " -- peace  ⁇  " is the word of the good god , rahest . "
and the word " rah " again , which is known in all abraham traditions , the same arabic root apex as the word " rah "  ⁇  mom  ⁇  and the symbolizes the feminist , the total of humanity , the whole humanity and the female narrator .
and just like the mother the embryo that grows in it , completely surrounds the basic framework of compassion feeds the entire existence .
and so we were told us , " my grace deserved all things . "
and so we were told us , " my grace 's recognized before my throat . "
let 's all of us will be given the distortion of grace .
thank you .
when i was little , i thought my country was the best in the world , and i grew up with the song " nothing to ben . "
and i was very proud .
in school , we changed the story of kim jong il , but we didn 't learn much about the world out there except for america , south korea and japan are our enemies .
although i often wondered how the outside the outside world is , i thought i would spend all my life in north korea to change everything in north korea .
with seven years of looking for the first time i saw an public , but i thought my life was normal in north korea .
my family was not poor , and i myself had never had to suffer hunger .
but in 1995 , my mother brought a letter , from the sister of a colleague .
and it said , " if you read this up , our five family members are not going to be on this world anymore because we 've had nothing for two weeks .
we 're stuck together on the ground and our bodies are so weak that we die soon . "
i was so shocked .
i heard for the first time that people were suffering in my country .
shortly after that , i went down at the station , and i saw something horrible that i can 't erase anymore from my memory .
a former woman was on the floor , and a child-eyed child in her arm , her mother 's face .
but nobody helped them because everybody was so busy taking care of themselves and their families .
in the mid-1990s , there was a big famine in north korea .
at the end , more than a million north koreans were favor of famine victims , and many more just because they ate grass , beetles and trees were eating trees .
power generation were getting more and more and more , so at night around me , except the lights of china on the other side of the bank , where we used to .
i always wondered why they had lights there and we didn 't .
this is a satellite image of north korea and its neighbors at night .
this is the river amines , which is part of a border between north korea and china .
as you can see , the river can be very shallow and allows north koreans , the escape velocity .
but many die .
sometimes i saw the bodies in the river .
i can 't tell much about how i left north korea , but i can say that during the devastating years of famine was sent to china to china .
i just thought that i was going to be separated for a short time from my family .
i 'd never thought it took me for 14 years to bring back again .
in china , it was very hard to live without a young girl without family .
i had no idea how life was going to be north koreans , but soon i learned that it 's not just extremely difficult , but it 's also very dangerous , because north koreans are seen in china as illegal immigrants .
so i lived in constant fear that my true identity could fly , and you would send me back into a terrible destiny to north korea .
one day , my biggest nightmare was true when i caught by the chinese police and turned into the police stationed .
someone was accused me to be north koreans , so they adopted my chinese skills and asked me countless questions .
i was such fear , i thought my heart would explode .
if anything unnatural may appear , i could be locked up and be denied .
i thought that would be the end of my life , but i managed to control my feelings and ask the questions .
and after they finished the questions , one official went to the other one , " that was a false papers .
she 's not a north koreans . "
and they let me go . it was a miracle .
some north koreans , he will return to china in foreign messages , but many are caught by the chinese police and occasionally .
these girls had great happiness .
even though they get caught , they were released only because of massive international pressure .
these north koreans were not so much happiness .
every year , northern north koreans are caught up in china and go to north korea , where they tortured , tortured , or publicly publicly .
although i 've been lucky , many other north koreans , it 's not that way .
it 's tragic that north koreans need to hide their identity and hard to survive .
even after they 've learned a new language and work , your world can be put on a moment in the head .
so after 10 years of hiding , i decided to go to south korea , and again , i started a new life .
in south asia , i was a bigger challenge than i thought it was .
english was so important that i had to start learning my third language .
and i also found the big difference between north and south korea .
we 're all the koreans , but inside we have very apart , because of 6 ⁇  years of division .
i got an identity crisis .
am i am south or north koreans ?
where am i come from ? who am i am ?
suddenly there was no country that my home could have been .
although i didn 't get the adaptation of the south korean life didn 't light , i had a plan .
i was preparing for the recording at the university .
just as i turned to my new life , i got a shock call .
the north koreans , the money that i sent my family , and as punishment was relocated my family , a remote place on the land .
they had to escape as quickly as possible , so i started to plan your escape .
north koreans , there must have an incredible shift on their way to freedom .
it 's almost impossible to cross the border between north and south korea , i took a flight back to china and made me to the north koreans border .
because my family didn 't speak chinese language , i had to lead them , over 2,000 miles across china and then to southeast asia .
the bus ride took a week , and we were almost caught nearly several times .
once , when the bus got hit , a chinese police officer came in .
he took the evidence of everybody , and started asking questions .
because my family didn 't have a chinese mind , i thought they would be arrested .
when the chinese officer 's funding was paying my family , i decided to stand up and told him that they would be tau , and i was a stand .
he looked at me , but luckily he believed me .
we managed to get it up to the lao border , but i almost had to use all my money to bribe the border of laos .
but even after we crossed the border , my family was incarcerated , because of illegal cross rehab .
after i paid money and bribe , my family was released within a month , but soon , my family was sent back to the capital of laos .
this was one of the biggest failures of my life .
i had done everything to help my family 's freedom , and we were so close to it , but my family was arrested , just before the south florida keys .
i went back and forth between immigration department and the police department , trying desperately to free my family , but i didn 't have enough money to pay back and money .
i lost all my hope .
and the voice asked me , " what 's going on ? "
and i was completely surprised that a stranger is taking care about it .
in broken english and with a dictionary , i explained my situation and without hesitation , he went to a bank , and paid the money for my family and two more north koreans to get them out of jail .
and i thanked him from all the hearts and i said , " why do you help me ? "
" i don 't help them , " he answered .
" i 'll help the north koreans people . "
i realized this was a symbol of my life .
the stranger used to come up with a new hope for me that the north koreans need so badly , and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of international community as the hope that the north koreans .
finally , after our long journey , my family and i was united in south korea , but the freedom is only one step .
a lot of north koreans are separated from their families , and once they arrive in a new country , they start with little or even any money .
the international community can help us in education , the english , the vocational education , education and many more .
we can also be the bridge between the people in north korea and the outside , because many of us remain in contact with families , and we send them information and money helping to change north korea .
i was so fortunate to get so much help and inspiration in my life , that i want to make hopeful north koreans , with international support .
i 'm sure you 're going to see a lot more successful native north koreans across the world , also on the stage of ted .
thank you .
i just have one please today .
please don 't tell me that i 'm normal .
i 'd like to introduce you my brothers .
remi is 22 , big and very handsome .
he can 't speak , but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speaker couldn 't speak .
remi knows what love is .
he shares it 's unconditional , and he shares it .
he 's not greedy . he doesn 't look at the skin color .
he doesn 't care about religious differences , and imagine himself : he never told a lie .
when he 's singing songs from our childhood , it tries to words that didn 't even remember me , he reminds me one thing : how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown unknowns must be .
samuel is 16 . he 's big . he 's very handsome .
he 's got an absolute risk memory .
but he also has a selectively .
he can 't remember if he stole my chocolate cake , but he remembered the published year of every song on my ipod , talking that we had when he was four , while the first episode of the telemarketers to my arm 's birthday .
don 't you listen to be incredibly ?
but many people don 't agree .
and in fact , because your mind doesn 't fit into the social version of normal , they 'll often came across and wrong .
but what changed my heart and my soul has been strengthened was that although this was the case , although they didn 't look as commonplace , it could only mean that they were extraordinarily extraordinary -- and extraordinary .
now , for those of you who are not so familiar with the term " autism " ; it 's a complex function of the brain that affects social communications , learning and sometimes physically function .
it 's different from each individual , so therefore , remi is so unlike sam .
and in the world , every 20 minutes in a new person in a new person , and although there 's one of the fastest growing developmental disorders in the world , there 's no known cause or cure .
and i can 't remember the first time i 'm autism , but i can 't remember no day without it .
i was just three years old when my brother was born , and i was so excited that i had a new creature in my life .
and after a few months , i realized he was different .
he screamed a lot .
he didn 't want to play what the other babies did , and in fact , he didn 't seem very interested in me at all .
remi lived and re-interest in his own world , with his own rules , and he found joy in the smallest things , like cars in a row in the room to keep the washing machine and eat everything that came under him .
and when he grew older , it became different and the differences became more visible .
but behind the anger and the frustrated and the frustrated and never ends up with a real shame is something really unique : an pure and innocent nature , a boy who saw the world without prejudice , a human who never had lied .
extraordinary .
now , i can 't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family , moments where i wish they were just like me .
but i 'm going to go back to the things they taught me about , about individuality , communication and love , and i understand that these are things that i wouldn 't want to exchange for normal .
normality , the beauty that give us , and the fact that we 're different , doesn 't mean that one of us is wrong .
it only means there 's a different kind of right .
and if i could just say one thing to say and to sam and to you , it would be that you don 't have to be normal .
you can be extraordinary .
because , autistic or not , the differences we have -- we have a gift  ⁇  every one of us has a gift in itself , and in all honesty , the pursuit of normality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential .
the chance of scale , progress and change in the moment where we 're trying to be like someone else .
please -- please don 't tell me that i 'm normal .
thank you .
now , edgray has filled us with awe and curiosity , with this photo on a project that an apple released an apple through a fear memory , and with only one millionth second .
but now , 50 years later , we 're a million times faster and see the world not with a million or a billion , but a trillion frames per second .
so i 'm going to introduce you to a new kind of photography , the f-to- photography , a new algorithm that 's so fast that it can make time series of light from light into motion .
and with this , we can build cameras , which is wrapped around the edges of our view , or without an x-ray image in our bodies and really ask what we mean with " camera . "
now , if i take a laser pointer , and i turn it in a trillion second and a second -- these are several feet -- -- i create a package of photons that 's hardly a millimeter , and this photons is launched , this photons , it 's going to start moving in the speed of light .
so , if you take this project , this photons , and shoot it into this bottle , how will these photons grow in the bottle ?
what does light in slow light ?
so , this whole event --
so , remember , the whole event takes less than a nanosecond -- so long it takes light to go back -- but i slowed this video around 10 billion to see the light in motion .
no , coca-cola hasn 't fund this research .
so , in this film happens very much , so let me analyze that and show you what happens .
the pulse , our project , goes into the bottle with a photons , which starts moving through , and it breaks inside .
part of the light goes out to the table , and you see this spread of waves .
many of the photons will ultimately reaching the deceptive of the bottle and explode in different directions .
as you can see , there 's a bubble bubble coming in the bottle .
meanwhile , the waves are spreading on the table , and because of the reflex of the top , you see that the reflex are focused on the end of the bottle are focused on some images .
now , if you take a very common project , and let it take the same track and slow the video around 10 billion , you know , how long you have to sit here to see the film ?
one day , a week ? no , a year .
this would be a very boring film -- -- -- from a slow , normal-by-size movement .
and what about something still-life photography ?
you can see again , these waves are the table , the tombs and the wall in the background .
it 's like throwing a stone into a pond .
it seemed like the nature would paint a picture , each of a fot picture , but of course , our eye sees an act of an act .
but if you look at these tomography again , you 'll see that if the light is going to keep the tomography , that continues to be broken . it 's not dark .
why is that ? because the tomography is ripe , and the light goes around in it , and after several trillion seconds comes back .
so , in the future , if these nasty camera in your camera camera , it could be possible that you can go into a supermarket and see if a fruit fly , without even touching them .
so how did my team built on this camera ?
so , as a photographer , you know , when you take a photo of short term , they have very little light , but we put a billion times faster than their shortest time , so they get no light like light .
so what we 're doing is we 're going to send this project , this photons , a million times , and we draw it back with very clever synchrony , and we combine this gigabyte , we 're putting these fecal plumes that i showed you .
and we can take all these raw stuff and make very interesting things .
so superman can fly .
other heroes can make themselves invisible , but how about a new super force for a future superheroes : can you see around corners ?
the idea is that we light something light on the door .
it 's going to go back into the room , a part of it 's going to bounce back to the door , and eventually we could exploit this more , and we could exploit that more of the light .
and this is not science fiction . we 've actually built it already .
on the left you see our fem-to-to-to-to-to- camera .
behind the wall is a puppet , and we 'll let the lights off the door .
after we published in the nature of nature 's paper was published , and they created this animation .
and because we have a camera that 's so fast -- our fem-n camera has some unique capability .
it 's got a very good time , and it can look at the world speed at the speed of light .
and of course , we know the distance the door to the door , but also the hidden objects , but we don 't know what the distance belongs to .
and by letting a laser , we can take a raw picture , which -- as you see on the screen -- not really makes sense , but then when we take a lot of these images , dozens of these images , and they 're trying to analyze the different light , we can analyze it ?
can we see it in 3d ?
so this is our reconstructed .
we have a lot more to do before we can do the lab into practice , we could build cars that avoid collisions , and see what 's behind the curve , or we can go into dangerous ones by looking at light , looking at the window , and see the window through the window , or we can enter the space , we can see what we can be able to see if we can be able
but because of the blood and tissue , of course , this is very challenging , which is really a wake-up call for scientists now to think about f-to- photography , because there 's a new picture of the next generation of medical problems .
but it 's also happens funny .
if you look at these waves under the bottles below the bottles , you see that the waves of us are moving away .
the waves should be moving towards us .
what 's happening here ?
it turns out that we 've taken almost in light at the speed , have strange effects and einstein would have seen this picture incredibly like to see this picture .
the sequence , in the events in the world will happen in the camera in reverse order , so by using the relationship of space and time , we can correct these distortion .
it 's time . thank you . thank you .
there 's a lot of ways we can improve our lives .
we don 't meet any neighbors on the street , so a lot of wisdom are not passed on , but we use the same public public places .
over the last few years , i 've been trying to share more with my neighbors , and use things like stickers , maker and chalk and chalk .
the projects came out of my questions , how much rent on my own little rent on my neighbors ?
how can we borrow more things without telling each other ?
how can we share our memories of the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better ?
and how can we share our hopes for vacant homes so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams ?
i live in new orleans and i love new orleans .
my soul is going to fall off the giant , which has been loving for hundreds of years , drunk and dreams and dreams . i trust a city where there 's always music .
i think every time somebody ever , there 's a parade .
in this city , some of the most beautiful buildings in the world , but it 's also the city with most abandoned reason in america .
i live near this house , and i was thinking about how i can stick it , and i also thought about something that changed my life forever .
in 2009 , i lost someone i loved .
her name was joan , and she was like a mother for me . her death came to suddenly and unexpectedly .
i 've thought a lot about death , and i felt a great gratitude for my life , and it taught me about the things that are important to me now .
but it 's hard to me , this view every day goes to stay alive every day .
it 's easy to lose in the day and forgetting what 's really important .
with the help of old and new friends , i 'm going to leave a side of the house into a giant board , and i wrote a mold called the gaps : " before i die , i want to die , " everybody who can take a piece of chalk and think about his life .
i wasn 't sure what i could expect in the experiment , but the next day , the wall was completely covered , and it grew up and grew .
i want to share some sentences with you that were written by the people on the wall .
" before i die , i want to be prosecuted because of piracy . "
" before i die , i want to be standing wide above the international telecommunications line . "
" before i die , i want to sing for millions of people . "
" before i die , i want to plant a tree plants . "
" before i die , i want to live on the web life . "
" before i die , i want to keep you again in my arms . "
" before i die , i want to be somebody 's cavalry . "
" before i die , i want to be myself . "
this false place was taken into a meaningful place , and the hopes and dreams of people brought me laugh to laugh and cry for me during the hard times .
it 's about knowing that you 're not alone .
it 's about understanding our neighbors , and it 's a new and illuminating way .
it 's about creating space and to think about , and remember what is most important as we grow and changing .
i did this last year , and i received hundreds of news from passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community , so my colleagues and i built a construction kit , and now in the world countries like kazakhstan , south africa , australia , and other walls .
we 've shown how much power our public places , when we have the opportunity to share our voices and share more with others .
two of the most valuable things we have is time and relationships to other people .
in a world with increasing distractions , it 's more important than ever before to look at things with the right view and thinking that life is short and delicate .
we 're often stopped talking about death or even thinking about it , but i realized that the preparation is one of the things that we most need to do .
the idea of death affected us life .
our common spaces are best showing us as individuals and as a community is important , and with more opportunities to share our hopes and stories , people can 't just help us create better places , they can help us live better .
thank you .
thank you .
so , i 'm dealing with applied mathematics . a special problem for anyone who 's dealing with basic math is that we 're like business consultant .
nobody knows what we 're actually do .
so today i 'm going to try to try to explain to you what i do .
dance is one of the most human activity .
we 're delighted with the sight of master of master ballet and steady , as you 'll see in the same .
for the ballet is an extraordinary amount of knowledge of knowledge and skills , and possibly a basic eigenetics that could have a genetic component .
sadly , dead causes neurological disorders like parkinson 's slowly , this extraordinary ability , and that 's what she does in my known , who was at his time , at its time .
over the years , you 've done a lot of progress in treatment .
and yet , there are 6.3 million people around the world who suffer from this disease , and you have to deal with the incurable malignancy like weakness , treor , stiffness and other lives that causes this disease , and that 's why we need objective the disease to detect before it is too late .
we need to measure the process of measuring , and ultimately , the only way to really know if there is healing , if we have an objective measure that this question can answer .
it 's alarming that it 's for parkinson 's , and other movements don 't have a biomarkers , so you can 't do simple blood analysis , and the best thing that there 's this 20-minute walk test .
you have to do it in the clinic . it 's very expensive , and that means , outside clinical trials will never done this . never .
but what if patients could do this test home ?
that would save a trip to the hospital . what if patients could do this test self ?
it wouldn 't be an expensive healthcare workers .
by the way , it costs 300 percent to study themselves in the neurological win .
and so i want to suggest to you a unconventional way of trying to do that , because we 're all , in some sense , in some sense , as my well-called janja .
here you see a video of vibrating strings .
this is happening in healthy state , when someone puts a speech , and we can look at as a vocal ballet dancer , because we have to coordinate all of these organs when we produce loud , and we all have the genes for it .
and like ballet would require a lot of exercise .
think about how long a child needs until it learns .
through loud , we can determine the position of the vibrating noise , and as the limbs are also affected by parkinson 's disease .
on the bottom hand , you can see an example of irregular arrangements of judgment .
we always see the same symptoms .
vocal , weakness , stiffness .
the language is even gets too far and it 's an example of an example of it .
these impacts on the voice can be minimal , sometimes , but with digital microphones and precision diet-based software , combined with new machine learning , which is now very advanced , we can now figure out where someone is in a disease and health , just because of the time .
how can these tests measure with clinical age ? well , they 're both noninvasively . the test in neurologist .
little . the infrastructure is already there .
you don 't have to build new clinics for this .
and both are exactly . they won 't be done by experts tests .
so you can be conducted .
they 're very fast , take 30 seconds of 30 seconds .
they 're very cheap , and we know what that means .
if something is extremely cheap , you can also put it in large extent .
so these amazing goals we can now reach with this .
we can reduce patients 's trouble for patients .
patients don 't have to do routine training in the clinic .
we can get objective data through so that we can get through a frequent observation .
we can do a high-scale mass amateur clinical trials for clinical trials , and the first study of the whole population will be done .
we now have the opportunity to look for the first recovery for the disease before it 's too late .
today , we 're going to take the first step in that direction , we start the parkinson 's voice voice .
with acababus and patient treatments , we would like to take a very high number of voices worldwide to have enough data , for what these goals .
we have reputation that are worth three billion people on this planet .
everybody , or without parkinson 's , can fake phone calls for a few cents , and i 'm familiar with delight that we 've reached six percent of our goal in just eight hours .
thank you .
if you take samples of , say 10,000 people , you can then say who is healthy and who isn 't ?
what will you do with all these specimens ?
what happened is that the patient 's got to tell during the phone call , whether this person suffers from parkinson 's disease or not . ok .
some of you may not will be able to end .
but we collect a huge database , under different circumstances , which is interesting . these circumstances are important , because we 're involved in order to see what the actual markers is for parkinson 's .
right now your 86 percent accuracy ?
it 's much better .
my student 's head -- i have to praise it because he 's done so fantastic work -- now it 's shown that it also works on the cell network , which enables this project , and we 're 99 percent accuracy .
that 's what i call improvement .
that means that people can -- people can call it on the phone and do the test . people with parkinson 's disease , let their voice , so that your physician can check the progress of the disease .
right .
thank you . maxxi , ladies and gentlemen  ⁇ 
thank you , tom .
here i live . i live in kenya at the southern edge of the nairobi , industrial park .
in the background , you see the cows of my father 's cows , and that 's behind the nairobi park is the nairobi park .
the nairobi park is only in the south places , which means that wildlife can leave the park anywhere .
the predators , the lions , follow them . and then they do this .
they kill our livestock .
this is one of our cows that was killed at night , and i woke up in the morning , and she found dead . it was terrible . it was our only one bullet .
my tribe , the maas , believes that we came together with our animals and the white stripes from heaven , and so our animals mean so much .
as a child , i learned to hate lions .
our warrior hot morans . they protect our tribe and our livestock , and they 're also upset because of this problem .
and killing the lions .
here 's one of six lions killed in nairobi .
and i think there 's only so few lions in the nairobi national park .
in my tribe , a young between six and nine years is responsible for the cows of his father , so it also took me .
i had to find a solution .
my first idea was fire . lions fear of fire .
but then i realized that it wouldn 't really would help us , but help the lions that cows better to see .
but i didn 't give up . i kept on .
i had a second idea . i tried it with a bird flu .
i wanted the lions thought i was next to the cow shed .
but lions are very bright animals .
you come , you see the bird shit and go back again , but the next time you come and say , this thing doesn 't move , that 's still there .
and they reach and killing our livestock .
one night i would disagree with a torch in the hand around him and this time , the lions don 't stop .
lions are afraid of light that moves .
i had an idea .
as a little boy , i was working the whole day in my room , and even the new radio my mother 's new radio , and the day she nearly drove me around me , but i had learned a lot about electronics .
i took an old automotive car battery , and i took a motorcycle store from a motorcycle . it shows whether you want to turn on the right or left .
and i got a switch to get the lights and neutral .
this is a little pear from a broken flashlight .
and then i built everything together .
the solar panel the battery , the battery provides the battery power on the board . i call it a transformationalator .
and the bellwether pills .
you can see that the birkends are coming out , because from where the lions come from there is the lions .
and this is what this looks like the lion , if you come .
the lights and the lions believe that i go around the barn , and i was in bed all the time in bed .
thank you .
i 've installed this in our home , and since we had no more trouble with lions .
and then our neighbors heard about it .
one of them was this grandmother .
she had lost many of their animals on lions , and she asked me if i could install her the lights .
and i said , " yes . "
i installed the lights . you can see the lions in the background .
since then , i 've got seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights , and they really worked really well .
my idea is now being used in all of kenya , including other predators like hyenas , or leopard -- the lights also serve to keep elephants from farms .
my invention sent me to a scholarship to one of the best schools in kenya , brook international school , and i 'm really excited .
my new school was engaged and helps by donations and education and enlightenment .
i even brought my friends home with me , and together we install the lights there where there 's no , and i 'll show people how to use it .
one year ago , i was just a boy from the savanna his father 's cows , and i saw airplanes about me and said , " one day i 'll sit in one  ⁇  "
and here i am here .
i was allowed me to fly with a plane , for my first tedtalk .
if i 'm big , i want to become an airplane and a pilot . that 's my big dream .
i used to hated lions . but through my invention , i can save the cows of my father 's cows , and we can share the lions together , with the lions , with no argument .
ash ⁇  ol ⁇ n . in my language that means , i thank you very much .
you don 't even know how exciting it is to hear a story like your listening .
so you have this scholarship . yes .
you work on other electric innovations .
what 's the next on the list ?
my next invention , well , i work on an electric fence . an electrical fence ?
yeah , i know electric fences are already invented long , but i want my own .
you 've tried it once , right -- yeah , i 've tried it before , but try again because i got a blow .
it 's hard . richard turin , you 're a little special .
we 're going to get you at every step of your neighbor , my friend .
thank you . thank you . thank you .
since i 've been old enough to keep a camera in my hand , photography is my passion , but today i want to share with you 15 of my favorite pictures , and not one of them i did .
there was no kind of directors , no sticks , no chance to shoot an image . not even the lighting was accepted .
to be honest , most of them were shot by random tourist .
my story begins when i was in new york , and my wife took this picture on which i hold my daughter on her first birthday , and we were on the corner of 5 ⁇  5 ⁇  5 ⁇  5 .
a year later , we were back in new york and so we decided to shoot the same picture again .
well , you can see where this goes ...
when the third birthday of my daughter , my wife said , " hey , why don 't you get organized in new york , and it 's a father 's journey to lead the ritual ? "
at that time , we started asking for us to take a picture of us .
you know , it 's remarkable how universal the gesture is if you 're a completely alien your camera .
no one has ever said no and fortunately , and fortunately , someone else has never stepped up with our camera .
we didn 't yet knew how much these journeys would change our lives .
this journey has become very sacred .
this was taken only weeks after 9  ⁇  11th , and i had to explain what happened in the day , so a five-year-old can understand it .
these pictures are much more than just a single moment , or a particular journey .
they 're also an opportunity for us , for a week in october , stop time and changing our time and how we change year from year , not just physically but in everything .
because although we always do the same picture , our perspective changes from time . as it always gets new milestones , i can see life with your eyes , as you see it .
this very intense time we spend with each other is something that we value and expect to be happy every year .
recently , while one of our journeys , we walked for a walk , and suddenly she was standing on a red flag of a doll dish which she learned as a little kid , at earlier .
and she told me about her feelings that she was at that point at that point .
she said she reminds her heart was like her heart jumped out when she first saw the store the store for the first time .
and now she looks up in new york to high schools , because she 's necessarily want to study in new york .
and i became clear : the most important thing we all create are memories .
and so i 'd like to share with you the idea of taking an active role in the conscious field of making memories .
i don 't know what it looks like with you , but apart from those 15 images , i 'm not on a family photo .
i 'm always who makes the image .
i 'd like to encourage you to come into the picture and ask someone , " would you a picture of us ? "
thank you .
