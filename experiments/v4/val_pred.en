when i was 11 years old , one morning , i was woken up a sound from the sounds of pleasure .
my father would stop on his little , awful radio the news show on the bbc .
he looked very happy about what was pretty unusual then , because the news was depressing .
he called , " the taliban are gone  ⁇  "
i didn 't know what that meant , but it obviously made my father very , very happy .
" now you can go to a real school , " he said .
i will never forget this morning .
a real school .
the taliban are taken in afghanistan when i was six , and banned girls to go to school .
and so for five years , i hated myself as a boy , and my older sister who were not allowed to date , to become a secret school .
only that 's how we could go to school .
every day , we took another way so nobody could guess where we went .
we hid our books in shopping for it looked like we just go shopping .
we were taught in a house about 100 girls in a little living room .
in winter it was comfort , but in summer it was incredibly hot .
we all knew that we risked our lives : teachers , students and our parents .
and over and again , the class had to fall for a week , because the taliban had suspicion .
we never knew how much they knew about us .
consider us ?
do you know where we live ?
we were frightened , but we still wanted to go to school .
i was very fortunate enough to grow up in a family where education as important and daughters were appreciated .
my grandfather was way ahead of his time .
an outsider from a remote province of afghanistan . he insisted to send his daughter -- my mother -- to school , and was forged by his father .
my educated mother but became a teacher .
that 's her .
two years ago , she went to retire , just to transform our house in a school for girls and women from the neighborhood .
and my father -- to see here -- was the first in his family who ever received an education .
it was clearly clear that his children would receive education , even his daughters , despite the taliban , despite all the risks .
he looked at it as a much bigger risk to send his kids not to school .
i still know that in the years , sometimes under the taliban has been so frustrated by our lives , feared and fear of perspective .
that i had lust , give up , but my father then said , " daughter , listen to me . you can lose everything in your life .
your money can be stolen . you can be distributed in the war from your house .
but one thing will keep you is that what 's in here , and even if we need to pay with our blood fees for your school fees , we 're going to do that .
so -- you still want to give up ? "
today , i am 22 years old .
i grew up in a country that had been destroyed by decades of war .
less than six percent of my age , a higher degree than the high school , and if my family didn 't have been used so much for my education , i would be one of these women .
instead , i 'm standing here today , as a proud during the midlife college .
when i got back to afghanistan , my grandfather , who was forged by his family , because he managed to send his daughters to school , one of the first person who congratulate me .
he 's not just about college degrees , but also with me that i was the first woman and i am driving him with the car through kabul .
my family believes to me .
i have big dreams , but my family still has greater dreams for me .
so i 'm a global ambassador for 10x10 , a global campaign for education for women .
that 's why i helped to build solo , the first and possibly the only boarding school for girls in afghanistan , a country where girls are still risky for girls .
it 's wonderful to see how the students in my school with great ambition that all of you want to perceive opportunities .
and to see how their parents and fathers once and fathers , as i was then , my parents for me , despite against all the transcripts .
like ahmed . that 's not his real name , and i can 't show his face , but ahmed the father of one of my students .
just a month ago , his daughter , and he on the way home froma in her village , and they 're dead by a bomb on the side by a few minutes ago .
when he arrived at home , the phone rang and a voice to tell him if he sent his daughter to school , they would try it again .
he said , " kill me now , if you want , but i 'm not going to put my daughter 's future because of your ancient and post-time ideas . "
in afghanistan , so i realized something that 's often being dismissed , behind most of us who succeed , is a father who sees the value of his daughter and aware that their success is also its success .
it doesn 't mean that our mothers don 't matter important role in our success .
in fact , they 're often the ones who initially and persuasive value for a promising future of their daughters , but in a society like in afghanistan , the support of men is essential .
under the taliban , a few hundred girls went to school -- because it was illegal .
however , in afghanistan today , in afghanistan about three million girls wearing school bank .
afghanistan seems different from america , so different .
the americans recognize how insecure changes are .
i 'm afraid that the changes are not permanent , and again , changes with the percent of the u.s. troops everything .
but when i 'm in afghanistan , when i see the students in my school , and their parents that encourage them , i see a promising future and a long-lasting change .
afghanistan , for me , is a country of hope and unlimited possibilities , and to remind me every day the girls who visit the solar .
just as i have you have big dreams .
thank you very much .
all i do , also , professionally -- my life -- was informed by seven years of work in africa as a young man .
from 19 ⁇ 1 to 19 ⁇  -- i look young , but i 'm not -- i 've worked in zambia , kenya , the ivory coast , algeria and somalia on projects with african countries .
i worked for an italian ngo and every single project that we ran onto the legs .
i was desperate .
i , 21 years , i thought that we 're good people and good work done in africa .
instead , we killed everything we measured .
our first project , which was my first book , " representation correlates with the zambatt " was one where we wanted to describe italian people to see how food is dominated .
we came to italy with italy in southern california ; in this amazing valley , which leads to the samburial river , and we taught local people to grow the population , and also tocadiums and ...
of course , the locals had absolutely no interest in this , so we paid them for work , and sometimes they popped up too .
we were amazed that there was no agricultural hubs in such a fertile species .
but rather than asking why they were nothing growing , we just said , " thank god we 're here  ⁇  "
" just in time to save people sambias before starvation . "
of course , all wonderful in africa .
we had this magnificent tomato . in italy , they became so large , in zambia .
we couldn 't believe it , and we said the samben : " look how easy agriculture is . "
when the tomatoes were ripe and red , overnight , about 200 districts came out of the river and all that .
we said to the sambg : " oh god , the hippopotamus  ⁇  "
and they said , " yes , so we don 't have agriculture here . "
" why didn 't you tell us ? " you never asked us . "
i just thought , italians were so great in africa , but then i saw what the americans did what the english people did , what the french did . after i saw what they did , i was pretty proud of our project .
at least we feed the nile .
you should see the nonsense -- -- you should see the nonsense that we have nothing of african people have gone .
you should read the book , " dead aid " by da vinci 's dan , she 's a sambacician .
the book was published in 2009 .
we 've been given the african continent 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years .
i 'm not going to tell you what this money has done .
just read your book .
check from an african , which we have .
we humans are imperialists , colonialists , mission , and there are only two ways that we deal with people . we pat them or we are patriarchal .
both words come from the latin root ' " father , " meaning . "
but they have two different meanings .
patriarchy : i 'm making everybody else 's a different culture than they were my children . " i love you so much . "
patisthis : i 'm saving every other culture as if they were my servant .
that 's why white people in africa are called " bawana , called " boss , boss .
i was held vigil when i read the book , " small is beautiful , " written by schum , and he said , especially in the economy of economics , if people don 't want help , let them stay in peace .
this should be the first principle of help .
the first principle of help is respect .
this morning , the gentleman who opened this conference , put a pole on the floor and said , " can you imagine a city that 's not mugs ? "
when i was 2 ⁇  years old , i decided to just react to people and invented a system called corporate profit , where never will ever write something , no one is motivated , but you become the service of the local people who have the local people who have a better person .
what you do -- you keep your mouth .
you never get a community of ideas , you sit with the local people .
we don 't work from offices .
we meet in cafes . we meet in pub .
we have no infrastructure .
we close friendships and figure out what the person wants .
the most important is passion .
you can give someone an idea .
if that person doesn 't like this person , what do you do ?
the passion for your growth of the person is the most important .
the passion for its own is the most important for humanity .
we help them find this because nobody can be successful alone .
the person with the idea may not know that , but it 's available .
many years ago , i had this effect : why instead of getting to a community and tell people what to do , why don 't we hear them ? but not in a community .
let me tell you a secret .
there 's a problem with community swirling .
entrepreneurs never have a part , and you 'll never say publicly , what you want to do with their money , what kind of opportunity you see .
planning has this blind spot .
the smartest people in the community , you don 't know because they never seem to be public .
we work one to do this , has to be produced a social infrastructure that doesn 't exist .
a new job has to be created .
this is the doctor of the company , the doctor 's house , who deals with them in the house , sitting on their kitchen table and in the cafe , helps them find the resources to transform their passion in a way to transform life .
i tried this in it in the west , western australia , trying .
i was a ph.d.d.d.d. and i tried to break down the objectified where we tell others what to do .
i helped these five fishermen , working together , and this wonderful tuna not to sell a factory in albany for 60 cents  ⁇  kilos , but to japan for 15 dollars for sushi dollars , and then farmers came to me and said , " hey , you helped help you help us ? "
in one year , i had 2 ⁇  projects . the government came to ask me , " how do you do this ?
how do you ... ? " i said , " i do something very , very difficult .
i keep your mouth and i hear you . "
so -- -- so the government says , " do it again . "
we 've done it worldwide in 300 communities worldwide .
we 've helped 40 companies that helped .
there 's a new generation of companies that go to loneliness .
peter printer , one of the best business consultant 's story , died with 96 a few years ago .
peter printer was a philosophy professor before he was involved with companies . peter printer said , planning is actually incompatible with an entrepreneurial society and the economy . "
planning is the death of the entrepreneurial spirit of the entrepreneurial spirit .
so , you build christian to come without knowing what the smartest person , wanting to do with their money and their energy .
you have to learn how to get these to get up .
you have to give them private , privacy and privacy , and you have to be great at helping them , and they 're going to get around .
in a community of 10,000 people we get 200 customers .
can you imagine a community of 400 people who can imagine intelligence and passion ?
which presentation you have the most cheer this morning ?
local , passionate people . these have them applaud .
i want to say that entrepreneurship is the right path .
we 're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- not a viable fossil fuels , manufacturing -- and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable .
the burns machine is not sustainable .
the freaks of maintain is not sustainable .
we need to look at how we feed seven billion people in a sustainable way , cure , transport , transport and correspond to them .
the technologies don 't exist for this .
who 's going to invent this technology for the green revolution ? universities ? forget it  ⁇ 
the government ? forget it  ⁇ 
it 'll be entrepreneurs . and you do it already now .
i read a wonderful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago .
there was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of new york city in 18600 .
in 1860 , they came together and speculative , which would happen in 100 years with the city of new york , and the conclusion was this : the city new york would not exist in 100 years .
why ? they looked at the curve , and they said , if the population is growing at this pace , they needed six million horses to get people out , and it would be impossible to deal with the crap of six million horses .
because they went to shit already .
in 1860 , you 'll see the dirty technology that wipe life from new york .
what happens ? 40 years later , 1900 , in the u.s.1 million car maker -- 1001 .
the idea of finding another technology , had done this race . there were tiny little factories in the h .
de di , michigan . henry ford .
there 's a secret to work with entrepreneurs .
first of all , you have to be a discretion .
otherwise , don 't come and talk to you .
next you have to offer them absolute , dedicated and passionate service .
then you have to tell you the absolute truth about entrepreneurship .
from the smallest to the biggest company , everyone needs to be able to sell three things : selling product needs to be grand , the commercial market needs to be grand and the financial book .
guess ?
we 've never met a single person who can produce something at the same time and sell care about money .
that doesn 't exist .
this person was never born .
we 've done research , and we were looking at the 100 iconic companies in the world -- carnegie , west , edison , the new companies , google , yahoo , yahoo .
there 's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world in common , only one thing : no one was founded by one person .
now we 're teaching 16-year-old in north america , entrepreneurship , and we start teaching them to give you the first two sides of richard branson , richard branson , and the task of 16-year-old , it 's in the first two sides of richard branson , how many times he used to him . "
never " i " and 32 times " we . "
he wasn 't alone when he started .
no one set up a company alone . nobody .
so we can create a community where , in facilitator who have a small entrepreneur , sitting in cafes and bars , and their dedicated buddy who are going to do what someone for this gentleman who 's talking about this epic . somebody who 's going to say what they need ? "
what can you ? can you make it ?
okay , can you sell it ? can you pay attention to the money ? "
" oh , no , i can 't . " " you want me to find someone for you ? "
we activate communities .
we have groups of volunteers who are supporting the organization in helping them find the resources and people , and we 've found that the miracle of intelligence in the local population makes the culture and the economy of this community can only be transformed through the sea of passion and energy imagination .
thank you .
five years ago , i learned how it must be , alice in wonderland .
the penn state university asked me -- a lecture for communication -- aspiring engineers in communication to communicate .
i was afraid .
real fear . fear of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big books , not familiar words .
but when the conversations developed , it taught me like alice , when she 's going down to be a hole and saw a door to a whole new world .
likewise , when i was talking to the students , and i was amazed by the thoughts they had and wanted others also discovered this wonder .
i think to open this door , it requires great communication .
we really need great communication about our scientists and engineers to change the world .
because our scientists and engineers are the ones that are our biggest problems , like energy , environmental and health , and if we don 't know about it , and it 's not going to go ahead , i think it 's in our responsibility as non- scientist , these conversations .
but these great conversations don 't get done when our scientists and engineers and engineers don 't invite us in their wonderland .
so scientists and engineers , please , we apply us .
i want to show you a couple of approaches how you can do it , that we can see that science and the technology that you 're doing , sexy and exciting .
the first question you have to answer us is : well and ?
tell us why your scientific area is so relevant to us .
doesn 't just tell us that their track records , but it also tells us that their trapeze muscles , looking at the harsh structure in our bones because it 's important to understand and treat osteopor and treat .
and if you describes what you 're doing , then they 're elected dictionary .
so words are an obstacle to understanding your mind .
i 'm sure you could use " time and timeline , " but why don 't you just say  ⁇  space and time , " which is much more sensible for us ?
to make your mind your mind , is not the same as your level of motor signals .
as einstein said , " do things as simple as possible -- but not simpler . "
you can surely tell us about your scientific area without having to compromise on compromise .
a few things are about this : examples , stories and analogies . in this way you can pull us in your spell .
and if you presented your work , let the points away .
have you 've ever wondered why it means " down point " ?
what happens when someone is heading ? another one 's only stabbed with these dots , and the first telling your audience .
one slide like this is not just boring , but it also continues too much on the language processing part of our brain , and so we 're quickly overwhelmed .
so , this example of genes of genes of genes is much more effective . it shows that the special structure of the tract is so stable that it was even the inspiration for the design of the eiffel tower .
the trick here is to use a single , easy sentence , just using the audience where once it loses the thread , orient . use pictures and graphics that also creates our other senses and creates a deeper understanding of what it describes .
these are just a few approaches that can help us open these door open and see the wonderland , which science and the tech in themselves .
since the engineers i 've taught to have taught me to make with the  ⁇  nerdy in me , i want to summarize everything with an equation .
pulls out of your science and your technical words , divide by relevance to the relevance , so the audience says what 's important , and multiply the whole thing with the passion you have for your incredible work , and it makes an unimaginable interactions that are full of new insights .
so scientists and engineers , if you solved this equation , it 's very difficult to focus .
thank you very much .
hi . that 's my phone .
a cell can change a life and give a personal freedom .
with a cell phone , you can film a crime of humanity in syria .
with a cell phone , you can tweet a message and start a protest in egypt .
and with a cell phone , you can pick up a song , uploads and famous .
all of this is possible with a cell phone .
i am a year 1984 and live in berlin .
let 's go back to this city at that time .
there you can see how hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of people went to the street and demonstrated .
we 're in 1989 , and we imagine that all these people who were up and asking changes , had a cell in your pocket .
who in the room has a cell phone ?
hold it up .
keep your cell phones up , hold it up  ⁇ 
hold it up . an android , a blackberry , wow .
that 's a lot . almost everybody now has a cell phone .
but today i want to talk about me and my cell phone and how it changed my life .
and i 'm going to talk about this .
this is 35.830 lines of information .
raw .
and why is this information there ?
because in summer of 2006 , the e.u.u.u. secondary condition has presented a policy .
this policy is called policy on the pre- britain 's data storage .
this policy is that every telephone company in europe , every internet service providers in the entire europe , has to store a range of user information .
who calls who ? who 's going to whom an email ?
who sends a text ?
and if you use a cell phone where you are .
all this information is saved for at least six months to two years of your telephone service or your internet service .
and all across europe , people stood up and said , " we don 't want it . "
they said , we don 't want to run this pre-time data storage .
we want self-determination in the digital age , and we don 't want the telephone companies and internet service providers all this information about us .
there were lawyers , journalists , priests , who all said , " we don 't want that . "
and here you can see how tens of thousands of people flocked to the streets of berlin and said , " freedom instead of fear . "
and some people even said this could be 2.0 2.0 .
the stasis was the secret police in eastern germany .
and i 'm also wondering whether this really works .
can really store all this information about us ?
every time i use my cell phone ?
so i asked my phone company , the german jew that was at the time the largest telephone company in germany , and i asked her , please send me all the information you 've had about me .
and i asked her once , and she asked her again , and i didn 't get the right answer , except for blank .
but then i told myself , i want this information , because it 's my life that you 're running on .
so i decided to set up a court against them because i wanted this information .
but the german review said , no , we won 't give you this information .
at the end , it came to a comparison with you .
i salute the charges where they were asking all of the information .
because in the meantime , the federal supreme court decided that the introduction of the e.u , the german line was essentially contested .
so i got this ugly brown envelope with a cd .
and on the cdc was this .
35.830 lines of information .
first i saw it , and i said to me , well , it 's a huge files . my .
but then i realized after a while : this is my life .
these are six months of my life in this file .
so i was a little skeptical , what should i do with this ?
because you see where i 'm where i 'm sleeping at night , what i do .
but then i said , i want to go to the public with this information .
i want to make you publication .
because i want to show people what 's in britain 's data .
and together with time and open data city , so i did this .
this is a visualization of six months of my life .
you can zoom in and zoom out , you can rewind and rewindable .
you can take every step i do , tracking .
and you can even see how i went from franklif with the train to go to kola , and how many calls i do .
all of this is possible through this information .
that 's a little bit of fear .
but it 's not just me .
it 's all of us .
first it 's just that , i call my wife and she calls me , and we 'll talk to each other a few times .
and then some friends start calling me and they call each other .
and after a while , they call them , and they call them , and we have this huge communications network .
but you can see how people communicate with each other , at which times they call each other when they go to bed .
you can see everything .
you see the central figures , about who the leaders of the group .
if you have access to this information , you can see what society is doing .
if you have access to this information , you can control society .
this is a blueprint for countries like china and iran .
this is the perfect design of how to monitor a society , because you know who talks to whom who sends an email , all this is possible if you have access to that information .
and this information is stored for at least six months , in europe to two years .
as i said at the beginning , let 's imagine that all of these people in the streets in berlin , we 'd had in their pocket .
and the sting had known who was in the demonstration , and if the torture knew who the leaders would have never happened .
the fall of the berlin wall might not have occurred .
and also not the case of the iron curtain .
because today , government agencies and companies want to store so much information as they can get over us , online and offline .
they want to have the opportunity to pursue our lives , and they want to store it all for a long .
but self-determination and life in the digital age are not an oxymor .
but you have to fight for self-determination today .
you have to fight for that every day .
so if you go home , tell your friends that privacy is a 21st of the 21st century , and this is not old .
if you go home , they say your deputy , just because companies and government have the opportunity to store specific information , you don 't have to do it long .
and if you don 't believe me , ask your phone company to the information you 've stored about you .
so , in the future , every time you use your cell phone , remember that you have to fight for self-determination in the digital age .
thank you .
i live in southern central .
this is south central : narratoros , fast food , fast , break up .
so the city planners come together and think about changing the name of central central to something else , so they changed him in south los angeles , as if this is something about what 's going wrong in the city .
this is south los angeles .
school chairs , fast , fast , break up .
as 26.5 million other americans live in the food desert in central london , the home of the drive-tus and the drive .
the funny is that the drive-tus killing more people than the drive .
people die in central central los angeles to cure conditions .
the rate in my neighborhood is higher than about five times higher than about beverly hills , which is about 15 kilometers away .
i couldn 't see that anymore .
and i wondered how you would feel if you didn 't have access to healthy if you had every time you go out of the house , the negative impact system that has the existing food system on your quarter .
i enlightened that roll of wheelchairs and being sold and sold like uses sports car .
i see dialysis centers up like starbucks .
and i realized this must stop .
i understood that the problem is the solution .
food is the problem and food is the solution .
i also didn 't bother to get more lust on 45-minute trip to get an apple that is not with pesticides .
so i planted a food forest in front of my house .
it 's a piece of land we call park .
it 's 45 feet .
the thing is , it 's the city .
but you have to care .
so i think , " cool . i can do what i want , because it 's my responsibility and i 've got to stand it . "
and i decided to stay this way .
so i came and my group , l.a. green space , and we started to eat my food forest , and fruit plants , plants , the whole program .
we 're kind of a kind of propulsion group , composed of gardening from all walks and out of the entire city , it 's totally voluntary and everything we do is free .
and the garden is beautiful .
but then someone complained .
the city came up to me , and he basically gave me a pre charge and he said that i have to remove my garden that became a judge .
and i thought , " come on , real ?
a judge judge for growing food on a piece of land that 's totally no matter to you ? "
and i thought , " cool . here it . "
because this time it wouldn 't be done .
the l.a. times was wind of it . steve lassz made a story about it , and spoke to the city council , and with a member of green ground , and they were doing a petitioned.org , and with 900 degrees among guys , we succeeded .
we kept the victory in the hands .
my city council even called up and said that you support it and love what we do .
so really , why shouldn 't you do that ?
l.a. in the united states , most collapsed in property ownership of the city .
they own 6 ⁇ 2,000 feet of collapsed .
these are 20 central park .
this is enough land to plant  ⁇ 25 million tomato plants .
why the heck you shouldn 't find this ok ?
by growing a plant , you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seeds .
with green beans in the value of a dollar , you get fruit and vegetables worth of  ⁇ 5 dollars .
it 's my sanctuary , i tell people to grow their own food .
its own food is how to print its own money .
see , i have a legacy in central central .
i grew up there . i raised my sons there .
and i refuse to be part of this preconceived reality that was made by other people , and i make my own reality .
see , i 'm an artist .
garden 's my graffiti . i mean plant my art .
just like a graffiti artist who 's lifted walls , i quit my lawns and parks .
i use the garden , the earth , like a piece of stuff , and the plants and the trees are my stuff for those stuff .
you would be surprised what the soil can use everything if you use it as a canvas .
you can 't imagine how amazing a sunflower is a sunflower , and how it touches people .
so what happened ?
i have experienced how my garden became an instrument for education and the transformation of my neighborhood .
to change the community , you have to change the composition of the floor .
we are the ground .
they would wonder how children are going to be influenced .
gardening is the therapeutic and courageous act that you can do , especially in the middle of the city .
moreover , you get strawberries .
i remember this time that mother and her daughter came , it was about 10 : 30 at night . they were in my backyard , and i came out and they looked so ashamed .
i felt really bad because they were there , and i told them , " you know , you don 't have to do that .
the garden is not without reason on the street . "
i 've been ashamed of when i saw people who were so close to me and they were hungry , and that 's just empowered me to do that . people said , " fin , you have no fear that people will steal your food . "
and i said , " to the devil , no , i 'm not afraid that they steal .
it 's on the street .
that 's the idea .
i want you to take it , but at the same time , i want you to take your health . "
at another time , i put a garden in this homeless housing in downtown l.a .
these are the guys who helped me dial up the truck .
it was cool , and they shared their stories about how it affects them , and how they 've planted with their mother and their grandmother , and it was great to see how it changed when it might only change for a moment .
you 've planted about 20 gardens .
we had 50 people , and they did it , and these are all volunteers .
when children grow food , children 's children 's food .
if you grow tomatoes , eat tomatoes .
but if you don 't get anything about it if they didn 't show them how food minds and bodies , they 're blind , whatever you present them .
i see young people who want to work , but they 're in this thing -- i see colored kids who are right on the path they 're supposed to be , and who 's leading nowhere .
the gardening , i see as an opportunity where we can train these kids to take care about their communities to lead a sustainable life .
and if we do that , who knows ?
we could create the next george washington carver carver .
but if we don 't change the composition of the ground , we will never do that .
so this is one of my plans . that 's what i want to do .
i want to plant a whole block of residential fires where people can share the food in the same block .
i want to take the shipping container and turn them into healthy cafe .
so don 't get me wrong .
i 'm not talking about free fuck , because free is not sustainable .
the funny thing about sustainability is that you have to stay through it .
i 'm talking about giving people work and bring children from the streets , and they bring the pleasure to the pride and the honor when you open your own food , and when you open farmers markets .
so what i want to do here is make this sexy .
i want us all of the ecological rebels , gangstero , gangsters .
we have to turn the image of gang star ratings .
if you 're not a gardeners , you 're not a gangster .
gangster you 'll be clear with ' nerdy shovels , right ?
and let the weapon of your choice .
if you want to meet with me , don 't call me when they want to sit in comfortable chairs and do a meeting where you 're talking about doing some of shit .
if you want to meet me , come with her shovels , in my garden so that we can plant any of the fuck .
peace . thank you . thank you .
thank you .
one of my favorite words in the entire oxford english dictionary is " snows " called snod . "
because it sounds so beautiful .
and " snodata " means " an dishonest politician . "
although in the 19th century a newspaper editorials , a better definition , " a snickers is someone who 's involved in authority , irrespective of party , or governance , and its success by simply the strength of the monumental language processing . "
i have no idea what " language is . "
something in words , i think .
but it 's very important that words are at the center of politics , and all politicians know that they have to try to control language .
in 1 ⁇ 1 , for example , according to the british parliament , newspapers , not the exact same word of the debates .
and this actually went back to the guts of a man with the extraordinary names of crohn 's who deals with the parliament .
they threw it in the tower of london and locked him in it , but he was brave enough , he was brave enough , and eventually he had so much support in london that he won .
and just a few years later , we find the first evidence for the sentence as strong as brug . many believe .
brankle refer to the english word for tank .
but that 's not true . it goes back to a advocate of press freedom .
but to show you how words and policy makers , i want to take you in the u.s. at the time when she has just reached independence .
you saw the question about how to call george washington , the head of state , you should call .
you didn 't know .
how do you call the leader of a republican nation ?
this has been edited for infinitely long argument about this .
and there were all sorts of anti- possible suggestions .
i mean , some people wanted to call him governor , and others , his majesty george washington , and again , others , protecting the freedom of the united states of america .
not so memorable .
some people just wanted to call him a king .
they thought it 's actually potentially .
they weren 't mon monarchistic , they wanted to choose the king for a certain amount of time .
it could have worked .
but everyone was enra bored , because this debate was saving three weeks .
i 've read the diary from a senator 's who constantly writes , " still the same theme . "
and the reason for the delay , and the boredom was that the kansas house was against the senate .
the kansas house didn 't want to do , that washington is power . they didn 't want it .
king call , and you might even bring him to ideas to follow .
they wanted to give him the humbly and most fierce titles to give them the best title , the best title they could think of them .
this title was " president . "
president . they didn 't invent the title . he didn 't existed before , but he only meant that somebody sing .
something like the jury of a jury .
he had no more size than the term " on " or " on the passport . "
sometimes there was a presidents of small regional commission and government groups , but it was really a trivial title .
and so the senate refused to tell him .
they said , " this is ridiculous , you can 't call him president .
this guy must sign treaty and the foreign minister would meet .
who 's going to take it seriously , if he has a stupid little title like president of the united states of america ? "
and even after three weeks , the senate , the senate was not after the senate .
you can learn three interesting things about it .
first of all -- and i think that 's the best -- until now i haven 't able to figure out if the senate ever had the president ever confirmed the president .
barack obama , president obama , has just borrowed the title , just waiting for the senate becomes active .
second , you can learn that if a government says something 's temporary -- then you wait 223 years later .
third , and that 's really important , that 's the most important point , is that the president of the united states of america today doesn 't sound like that anymore , right ?
this has to do with something more than 5,000 nuclear warheads that he has and the largest economy in the world and a fleet and all this stuff .
reality and history have given the title size .
and so the senate ended .
you got a respect title .
and the other concern of the senate , who looks of idiosyncratic -- well , back then it was like this .
but you know how many nations have a president ?
14 ⁇  .
because they all want to sound like the guy with the 5,000 nuclear warheads , etc .
so the senate at the end of the senate , and the representatives lost house , because no one feels when you 're told you 're now the president of the united states of america .
and that 's the most important thing you can take , and i 'll leave with .
politicians try to use words to shape the reality and control reality , but in fact , reality changes much more than words could ever change reality .
thank you very much .
so i came to a truck with about 50 rebels in fighting in combat , a 19-year-old , vegetarian of jacksonville , florida .
i 'd covered my black box half a pair of brown shoes against a few brown leather and fire a rocket towards the government dance that i couldn 't even see .
this was the first time i was in afghanistan .
for a long before that , i 'd gotten up with the war with the war , except for pythagoras and footballers and footballers and play with a racist enactment of south asia and religion colliding , and hokey mentality that i 've been living with the communism and long enough back into afghanistan .
but that 's the geography of the self .
and so i 'm standing here , curved afghan , south-states of god -- an atheist and a radical artist who lived for the last nine years in afghanistan and created .
so , in afghanistan there are lots of great things that you could do art , but i personally don 't like rain of rain . i want to do art that make up the personality and challenge and challenge and hypocrisy and trying to scratch the reality , and even trying to use a kind of fantasy of peoples .
i want to spend a day in the life of an jihad , who led his jihad against communistists like " pop bubble " struck and the armed religious faith and political corruption to enrich himself .
and what else can do to run the jihad as for parliament and making a choice campaign with the slogan : " i do jihad and i 'm rich . "
and try to use this campaign to de this mafiiosi that spend on as national hero .
i want to go to the corruption in afghanistan with a project called " back-up ass , " where you 're spending as a policeman , a false check on the streets of kabul , and cars stop , but instead of taking bribes from you to take money and give them money , and edit into the name .
i want to look at how the conflict in afghanistan in my mind has become the fashionable conflict .
the war and the strangers that came with him , created a new environment for style and fashion , which you can only capture a fashion designs for soldiers and suicide bombers in which i 'm talking about the coal-to-champing back into a future , or if you created a supercharging multiple tv .
and i 'd like to see how a simple copy of kabul from kabul , from now , from 1899 to create a dialogue about today that today 's development their roots into early stages of terrorism -- the burden of the white man , " to avoid the brown to avoid the brown guy .
but for all of these things , you can come to jail , they can be misunderstood , misinformation .
but i 'm doing it because i have to because the geography of the self it demands .
this is my load . which is your ?
thank you .
hi . my name is cameron russell and i 've been working as a model .
for 10 years , exactly .
i feel that now that there 's an awful tension here , because i shouldn 't have dress this dress .
luckily , i have something to switch on it .
this is the first time someone 's hacking around the ted stage , so you can appreciate that , i think .
if a few women were really startled when i came out , you don 't need to tell me now that i read later on twitter .
i also realize that i 'm pretty privileged , because i can change in very short 10 seconds that you think of me .
not everybody has the chance .
these paragraphs are very uncomfortable , it 's good that i didn 't want to wear them anyway .
the hardest part is to pull the sweater over my head , because then you 're all going to laugh at me , so nothing , as long as it 's over my head .
all right .
why did i do this now ?
that was embarrassing .
now , hopefully it wasn 't as embarrassing as this picture .
an image is powerful , but an image is also surface .
i 've just completely changed their opinions in six seconds .
and in this picture -- i actually never had a friend .
i felt very uncomfortable , and the photographer told me that i should have to put my back and with my hand into the hair of this guy .
and apart from surgery or the wrong wedding , which i would give me two days ago for the work , there 's very few opportunities to change our external , and our external act -- although it 's superficial and climate change -- a big impact on our lives .
being fearless is to me , to be honest today .
and i 'm on this stage because i 'm a model .
i 'm on this stage because i 'm a lovely , white woman , and in my industry , we call this a sexy girl .
i 'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but in the honest way .
the first question is , " how do you become a model ? "
i always say , " oh , i was discovered , " but that doesn 't mean anything .
the real reason i became a model is a win in the genetic lottery and an important heritage , and perhaps ask yourself what this legacy is made of .
now , in the last few centuries , we have beauty not only as healthy and young and symmetrical , where we 're biodegradable , but also as big , slim and bright and bright .
this legacy was created for me . and it 's a legacy that goes for me .
i know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point , and maybe some fashionistas might call " stop . naomi , tyler . joanne . "
and first , i meet their model . very impressive .
but unfortunately , i 've got to tell you that in 200 ⁇  , a very ambitious graduate student of nyu all models on the run , every single one that was hired , and that at 6 ⁇  ⁇  ⁇  percent models were only 2 or less than four percent .
the next question that 's always being asked me is , " can i be a model when i grow up ? "
and first of all , i say , " i don 't know , that 's not in my responsibility . "
but the second answer i really want to give this little girls is , " why ?
you know what ? you can become anything .
you can become the president of the u.s. , or the inventor of the next internet or a ninja master 's uniform , which would be totally insane , because then you were the first one . "
if you 're still saying , " no , no , cameron , i want to be a model , " i 'll say , " will my boss . "
because i don 't have a responsibility for nothing , and you could be the editors of the american bird 's , or the ceo of h  ⁇  m or the next steven .
to say later , you want to be a model later , is like saying that once you want to win the jack on the lottery .
you can 't affect it , and it 's fantastic , and it 's not a career path .
now i want to demonstrate to you 10 years to demonstrate model model , because unlike heart surgeons , it can only just be treated now .
it looks something like this .
i hope less than that in the middle .
that was -- i don 't know what happened there .
if you finished school and you 've done a r ⁇ sum , and a few jobs , unfortunately , you can 't say much more . if you say that president of the u.s. , but in r. r  ⁇  10 years of underwear , you 're going to be weird .
the next question that 's often asked me is , " all of the photos are taken over ? "
and yes , pretty much of the photographs are edited , but that 's just a small part of what happened .
this is the very first picture i 've done , and this was the very first time i had a bikini , and i didn 't even have my period .
i know this is going to be quite personal now , but i was a young girl .
this is what i just looked like a few months before with my grandmother .
that 's me the day of this shootby .
my friend had to accompany me .
this is me on a slumber party , a few days before a supermarket for the french bird .
this is me with the football team and v magazine .
and that 's me today .
and i hope you see that these images are not images of me .
it 's constructive , and it 's constructed by a group of professionals , of hairy and makeup artists and photographers and photographers , and all the assistants and all the assistants in front and production . they 're not me .
okay , next people always ask me , " you 're doing things for nothing ? "
yeah , i 've got too many 20-inch heel that i can never wear , except , but the things i get for free are things i get in real life , and we don 't like to talk about .
i grew up in cambridge , and one day i went to a shop and had forgotten my money , and you gave me the dress for free .
when i was a teenager , i drove to my friend with , a terrible driver , and she went over a red light , and of course we were pulled . it only took one : " excuse , sorry , " and we could go on .
i got these free things because of my look and not because of my personality , and there are people who look because of their personality and not pay because of their personality .
i live in new york and from 140 teenagers who have been pulled over the last year and full , 85 percent black and latino and young men .
it 's life in new york just 1 ⁇ ,000 young , male black and latino , for which don 't question the question : " am i 'm stopped ? "
but , " how often i 'm stopped ? when i 'm stopped ? "
in my research , i found out that 53 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the united states don 't like their bodies , and that number up to  ⁇ 8 percent when they become 1 ⁇  .
the last question to me is , " what is it is to be a model ? "
and i think they expect that answer : " if you 've got a bit thinner and shine hair , you feel very happy and fabulous . "
and backups , we give an answer that perhaps gives this impression .
we say , " it 's really great to travel as much , and it 's great to work with creative , inspired people . "
it 's true , but it 's only half of the story , because what we never ever say before the camera , which i never said before the camera is , " i feel unsure . "
and i feel unsure , because every day i have to think about my look .
and if you ever wonder , " would i be happier if i had thin legs and shine hair ? "
then you should meet some models , because they have the thin legs and the shiny red hair and the coolest ones , and they 're probably the ones that are probably most insecure women on the planet .
when i prepared this talk , it seemed very difficult to draw an honest balance , because i felt very uncomfortable with me to sit down here and say , " i got all the benefits of a pile that was being mixed up to you , " and it doesn 't feel good enough to do so well . "
it was very hard to share a legacy of oppression for gender and race , when i 'm one of the greatest useless .
if you take something out of this talk , hopefully we all recognize the power of the image in our supposed to determine and failures .
thank you .
i never forgot the words of my grandmother 's words that have come to live in exile : " son , lensinks him .
but i 'll never become something like a gaddafi , ever . "
now , almost two years have passed since the libyan revolution has been inspired , inspired by the waves of massaged both in the tunisian and in the egyptian revolution .
i 'm allies with many other libyan guys inside and outside of libyan to ask a day of anger , and to launch a revolution against the tyrann regime of gmock .
and she was , a big revolution .
boy , libyan women and men were standing in the first row , the end of the regime , sleds the freedom , and social justice into the air .
they 've proven examples of arrest by putting up against the brutal ancient rainforests .
you 've shown a strong sense of solidarity from the far east beyond the far west , until the south .
finally , after six months violent war and almost 50,000 dead , we managed to free our country and crashing the tyrants .
and gaddafi , however , has a big burden left , a legacy of corruption , corruption and the basis for change .
over four decades of gaddafi , both the infrastructure and the culture and the moral structure of society .
the devastation and the challenges , i burned , how many women other women to rebuild civil society of societies , and we asked the resolution and fair transition to democracy and national effort .
nearly 200 organizations were formed while and immediately after the case of gaddafi in benghis , almost 300 in trichis .
after 33 years in exile , i came back to libyaias , and with unique enthusiasm , i began to organize the themes of human development and leadership development .
with a wonderful group of women , i started bringing peace-up company , a movement of women , leaders from different spheres of life , whose goal is to stand for the most cosmopolitan empowerment of women and for our right to equal rights on equal rights and democracy .
in front of the elections , i met in a very difficult environment , a environment that has been more and more polarized , an environment that was dominated by the selfish politics of dominance and exclusion .
i led an initiative of peace-long content to encourage women to achieve a participatory choice , a law that every citizen , no matter what , should be right to vote and running and playing against political parties and particularly to avoid political parties , between a political parties and a difference between women 's moral and candidate .
at the end , our initiative was taken over and successfully .
women would win 1 ⁇ .5 percent of the national congress in the first elections for 52 years .
but slowly , surely the euphoria of elections and the entire revolution -- because every day we wake up to new news of violence .
we woke up a morning , we ran to the mel gibbergs and the sufi songs .
in another morning , we got news about the murder on american ambassador and attack on the message .
and again , another morning , the feedback cycles of off the army officer .
and really every day we awakening the rule of the military rule and continue to fight against human rights and their failures of rules and laws .
our society , shaped by a coherent sense of mental illness , polarized and away from the ideal and principles , " freedom , social justice  ⁇  that they had at first .
intolerance , out of exclusion and revenge became the icons of the revolution .
i 'm not there today to inspire them with the success story of our part-acre list and the elections .
rather , i 'm here today to confess that as a nation that made false choice and the wrong decisions .
we set our priorities wrong .
because elections didn 't bring peace nor stability or security in libya .
has brought about one-and-one list and the interplay between female and male command peace and national reconciliation ?
no , that didn 't .
what is it then ?
why is our society will continue to be polarized and dominated by selfish politics of dominance and the dominance , both from men and women ?
perhaps the women weren 't the only the missing , but the female values of compassion , the grace and the exclusion .
our society needs a national dialogue and consensus as it took the elections that at the end have only invization and rehab .
our society needs the qualitative senior embodiment of female more than it needs the numerical , quantitative embodiment of the female .
we need to stop acting in the name of anger and ask a day of revenge .
we need to start in the name of compassion and the grace .
we need to develop a female discourse that doesn 't just pick up the following value , but it 's also about : grace instead of revenge , rather than competition , rather than exclusionary rather than exclusion .
these are the ideals that desperately desperately need desperately claw to achieve peace .
because the peace has an al chemistry , and in this alessi , it 's about the feminist 's self-and-and-and-like ways .
that 's the real one-and-a-and-one .
and that 's what we need to lever before we do it more cosmopolitan .
after a verse from the quran " salam " -- peace  ⁇  " is the word of the good god , rae . "
the word " rah " again , which is known in all abraham traditions , has the same arabic root like the word " rah " mother  ⁇   ⁇  and symbolizes the mothers , which is all around humanity , of the male and the female , all of those individual and the male .
and just like the womb , the embryo that grows in it , completely surrounds the basic framework of compassion is the whole existence .
that 's why we said , " my grace , all things became . "
and that 's why we said , " my grace has embraced before my chubut . "
and may all of the favor of the favor of grace .
thank you very much .
when i was small , i thought my country was the best in the world , and i grew up with the song " nothing to envy . "
and i was very proud .
in school , we told the story of kim ils , but we didn 't learn much about the world out there except that america , south korea and japan are our enemies .
although i often wondered how the outside the outside the outside , i thought i would spend all of my life in north korea , to a whole time .
at seven years old , i first saw a public execution , but i thought my life in north korea was normal .
my family was not poor , and i had never had to suffer hunger .
but in 1995 , my mother brought a letter with a sister from a sister in 1995 .
it said , " if you read this , our five family members are not going to be in this world , because we haven 't eaten for two weeks .
we 're lying on the ground and our bodies are so weak that we 're dying soon . "
i was so shocked .
i heard for the first time that people suffer in my country .
shortly after that , i went over at the station , and i saw something horrible that i can 't erase anymore from my memory .
a bloodless woman lay on the floor , and a child-aged child looked into her arm her mother 's face .
but nobody helped them because they were so busy caring for themselves and their families .
in the mid-1990s , there was a big famine in north korea .
at the end , more than a million north koreans were victims of famine , and many more survive only because they ate grass , beetles and tree eating tree .
blackouts were getting more and more , so that night around me , around me , except the lights of china on the other side of the bank where we lived .
i always wondered why they had lights there , and we didn 't .
this is a satellite picture of north korea and his neighbors at night .
this is the river on the amines , which is partly as a border between north korea and china .
as you can see , the flow can be very subtle and allows north koreans to escape the escape .
but many die .
sometimes i saw bodies in the river .
i can 't tell much about how i left north korea , but i can say that during the devastating years of famine was sent to china .
i just thought i would be separate for a short period of my family .
i never would have thought it takes 14 years to bring it back together .
in china , it was very hard to live a young girls without family .
i had no idea how life would be as north koreans , but soon i learned that it 's not just extremely difficult , but it 's also very dangerous . because north koreans are seen in china as illegal immigrants .
so i lived in constant fear that my real identity could fly , and you would send me back to a terrible fate to north korea .
one day , my greatest nightmare was true when i was caught by the chinese police police station , and was brought in the police police station .
somebody accused me to be north koreans , so they tested my chinese skills and asked me countless questions .
i was such fear , i thought my heart would explode .
if anything unnatural appear , i could be locked up and jail .
i thought that would be the end of my life , but i managed to control my feelings and i answered the questions .
and after they finished the questions , one official said to the other , " this was a false entry .
she 's not a north koreans . "
and they let me go . it was a miracle .
some north koreans , in china for foreign fighters , but a lot of them are caught by the chinese police and others .
these girls had great fortune .
even though they were caught , they were released because of massive international pressure .
these north koreans were not so lucky .
every year , tons of north koreans are caught in china and found north korea , where they tortured , locked up or publicly .
although i 've been lucky in my flight , there 's not so many other north koreans .
it 's tragic that north koreans have to hide their identity and hard to survive .
and after they 've also learned a new language and work , their world can be posted on a moment .
after 10 years of hiding , i decided to go to south korea , and again , i started a new life .
i was in south korea , a bigger challenge when i thought it .
english was so important that i had to start learning my third language .
additionally , i 've noticed the great difference between north and south korea .
we 're all koreans , but inside , we have very divergent , because of 6 ⁇  years of division .
i had an identity crisis .
am i am south or north koreans ?
where am i come from ? who am i ?
suddenly there was no country that my home could have been .
although i didn 't light the adaptation of the south korean life , i had a plan .
i was preparing myself in university .
just as i became my new life , i got a shock call .
the north korean authorities started off the money i sent my family , and as punishment was forced my family forced into a remote place on the country .
they had to escape as fast as possible , so i started planning your flight .
north koreans , there must be an incredible walk on their way to freedom .
it 's almost impossible to cross the border between north and south korea , and ironically , i took a flight back to china and made me on the way to north koreans .
because my family didn 't speak chinese , i had to lead them more than 2,000 miles across china and then to southeast asia .
the bus ride took a week , and we were caught nearly a few times .
once the bus was stopped , a chinese police officer came in .
he took the evidence of all and started asking questions .
because my family no chinese mind , i thought they would be arrested .
when the chinese officials to address my family , i was determined , and i told him that they were mesh , and i was your oversight .
he looked at me , but luckily he believed me .
we managed to get to the lao border , but i had to use almost all my money to bribe the border from laos .
but even after we crossed the border , my family was detained , because of illegal cross borders .
having paid money fine and bribe , my family was released within a month , but soon my family was incarcerated again in the capital of laos .
this was one of the biggest setbacks of my life .
i had done everything to help my family freedom , and we were so close to it , but my family was arrested just about the south korean message .
i went back and forth between the immigration and the police station , trying desperately to free my family , but i didn 't have enough money to pay back or pay money .
i lost all my hope .
and he asked me the voice of a man , " what 's going on ? "
i was completely surprising that a stranger cares about this .
in broken english and with a dictionary , i explained my situation and no hesitation , he went to a bank , and paid the money for my family and two more north koreans to get them out of jail .
i thanked him from his heart and i said , " why do you help me ? "
" i don 't help you , " he answered .
" i help the north korean people . "
i realized this was a symbolic moment in my life .
the former strange symbol for me is a new hope that the north koreans desperately needed , and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the international community support as the hope spots , the north koreans need .
finally , after our long journey , my family and i reunited in south korea , but the freedom is only a step .
many north koreans are separated from their families , and once they arrive in a new country , they start with little or even any money .
the international community can help us with education , the english , vocational skill , skills and more .
we can also be the bridge between the people in north korea and the outside world , because many of us still stay in contact with families , and we send them information and money helping to change north korea from inside .
i was so fortunate to get so much help and inspiration in my life , that i want to get hopeful north koreans , to help address international assistance .
i 'm sure you 'll see a lot more successful north koreans all over the world , also on the stage of ted .
thank you very much .
i only have one request today .
please don 't tell me that i 'm normal .
so i want to introduce you my brothers now .
remi is 22 , big and very handsome .
he can 't speak , but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers could not speak .
remi knows what love is .
he shares it in unconditional , and he shares it .
he 's not greedy . he doesn 't look at the color .
he doesn 't care about religious differences , and just imagine , he never told a lie .
when he 's singing songs from our childhood , to try to remember which i don 't even remember , he reminds me one thing : how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown to be .
samuel 's 16 he 's big . he 's very handsome .
he has an absolutely useless memory .
he also has a selectively .
he can 't remember whether he stole my chocolate chocolate , but he remembered the published year of every song on my ipod , talking that we had when he was four , while the very first episode of the telegraphic sounds on my arm , and he went to my lady .
don 't listen to be incredibly ?
but a lot of people don 't agree .
and in fact , because your mind doesn 't fit in society 's version of normal , they 'll often be over and wrong .
but what my heart encouraged and encouraged my soul was that , although this was the case , although they weren 't usually considered , this could only mean that they were extraordinarily gifted -- and extraordinary .
now , for those of you who are not so familiar with the term " autism , " it 's a complex function of the brain that affect social communication , learning and sometimes skills .
it looks different from each individual different , so it 's so unlike sam .
and in the world , every 20 minutes in a new person in autism , and even though it 's one of the fastest growing developmental disorders in the world , there 's no known cause or cure .
and i can 't remember the first time i 'm autism , but i can 't remind myself without it .
i was only three years old when my brother was born , and i was so excited that i had a new creature in my life .
and after a few months , i realized he was different .
he yelled very much .
he didn 't want to play the other babies , and in fact , he didn 't seem very interested in me at all .
remi lived and re-in in his own world , with his own rules , and he found joy of the smallest things , like cars in a row in a room that brought the washing machine to eat everything that was coming under him .
and as he got older , it became different and the differences were more visible .
but behind the anger , and the frustrated and the frustrated and never ended up with hyperactivity was something really unique : a pure and innocent nature , a boy who saw the world without prejudice , a human who never lied .
extraordinary .
well , i can 't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family , moments that i wished they were just like me .
but i 'm going back to the things that they 've taught me about individuality , communication and love , and i understand that these are things i wouldn 't want to exchange for normality .
normal , the beauty that give us differences , and the fact that we 're different , doesn 't mean one of us is wrong .
it just means there 's a different kind of right .
and if i could just say one thing to remi and sam and to them , it would be that you don 't have to be normal .
you can be extraordinary .
because , autistic or not , the differences we have -- we have a gift  ⁇  each of us has a gift . and in all honesty , the pursuit of normal , the ultimate victims of potential .
the chance of scale , progress and change dies in the moment we 're trying to be how someone else .
please -- don 't tell me that i 'm normal .
thank you .
now ,ccdton has served us with awe and curiosity , with this photograph on a project on an apple with an apple orchard , and with a hot time of only one millionth of a second .
but now , 50 years later , we 're a million times faster and see the world not with a million or a billion , but a trillion frames per second .
so i 'm going to present to you a new kind of photography , the f-to-to- photography , a new map that 's so fast that it can generate time shots of light from light .
and with this , we can build cameras , looking outside of our view , or without an x-ray photographs in our bodies and really ask what we mean with " camera . "
now , if i take a laser pointer and i take it in a trillion times a second and turn it -- that 's several forms -- -- i create a package of photons that 's hardly a millimeter wide , and this photons , it 's a six-inch period , moving back into a current rate .
so if you take this project , this photons , and you take it into this bottle , as these photons will break in the bottle ?
what does light look like light in slow motion ?
so , this whole event .
so , remember , the whole event actually takes less than a nanosecond -- that 's how long it takes light to go back this route -- but i slowed this video to see 10 billion so you can see the light moving .
no , coca-cola did not fund this research .
so , in this film happens very much , so let me analyze it and show you what happens .
the pulse , our project , goes into the bottle with a photons that begins to move through , and that breaks down .
part of the light goes to the table , and you see this spread of waves .
many of the photons achieve the bottle of the bottle and explode in different directions .
as you can see , there 's an air bubble coming in the bottle .
meanwhile , the waves spread out on the table , and because of the reflex of the top , you 'll see that the reflex at the end of the bottle are focused on some images .
now , if you take a common project , and let it take the same route , and the video back at the factor 10 billion , you know how long you have to sit here to see the movie ?
one day , a week ? no , a year .
this would be a very boring movie -- -- from a slow , normal project in motion .
and what about it looks like something still-life ?
you can see again , like this wave the table , the tomates and the wall in the background .
it 's like throwing a pond into a pond .
it appeared to me , as if nature paint this picture , each of a f-to-peer , but of course , our eye holds together an isolated thing .
but if you look at this tomates again , you 'll realize that if the lights over the steam , that 's going to be lit up . it 's not dark .
why is that ? because the tomates is ripe and the light goes around and come back after several trillion seconds a few seconds .
so , in the future , if this f-to-the-to-the camera in your camera , it could be possible that you can go to a supermarket and see if there 's a fertile shot without even touching it .
so how did my team at mit built this camera ?
so when photographers do you know when you take a picture with a briefcase , you 've got very little light , but we put a billion times faster than your brevity , so you get as good as no light .
so what we do is we 're going to send this project , this photons , million times , and drawing the again , and again , very clever synchronization , and we combine these gigabits of data , we 're able to create these f-to- photographs that i showed you .
and we can take all these raw raw stuff and make very interesting things .
so , superman can fly .
other heroes can make themselves invisible , but what about a new super power for a future superhero : to corners ?
the idea is that we light on the door .
it 'll rip off , going into the room , a part of it will bounce back to the door , and then finally back to the camera , and we could use that more times the light of light .
and that 's not a science fiction . we 've even built it .
on the left you see our f-to-n camera .
behind the wall is a puppet , and we 'll let the lights off on the door .
after our paper was published in nature 's " nature 's " published , " and they 've been created this animation .
and because we have a camera that 's so fast -- our fick camera has some unique capability .
it has a very good time-powered , and she can look at the world at the speed of light .
and by that , of course , we know the distance to the door , but also the hidden objects , but we don 't know which point to which distance .
by making a laser scanning , we can shoot a raw image that -- as you can see on the screen -- not really makes sense , but if we record many of these images , dozens of these images , and then they put them together and try and analyze the different lights , we can see the object .
can we see it in 3d ?
so this is our reconstruction .
we still have a lot to do before we can put this from the lab in practice , we could build cars that avoid collisions and detect what 's behind the curve , or we can go into dangerous places by looking for dangerous places by looking at light that hole through the window , we can reflect on the storm .
but because of the blood and tissue , of course , it 's very challenging , which is really a wake-up call for scientists , now thinking about comedy-to-peer , because there could actually solve a new picture of medical technology problem .
but it also happens something fun here .
if you look at these waves under the bottles of the bottles , you see that the waves of us move away .
the waves should move toward us .
what happens here ?
it turned out that we take almost at the speed of light , have strange effects and einstein would have seen this picture incredible .
the order , in the events that happen in the world , appear in the camera in reverse order , so by applying the corresponding relationship of space and time , we can use these distortion .
it 's time . thank you . nice .
there are many ways that our fellow human beings can improve our lives .
we don 't meet every neighbors on the street , so many people don 't get transmitted down , but we use the same public places .
in the last few years , i 've been trying to share more with my neighbors and using things like sticker , stencils and chalk .
the projects came out of my questions , how much rent my neighbors are paying my neighbors ?
how can we borrow more things without disturbing each other ?
how can we share our memories of the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better ?
and how can we share our hopes for vacant homes so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams ?
i live in new orleans and i love new orleans .
my soul is going to calm down from the huge ulcer that have been loving for hundreds of years of loving , drunk and dists . i trust a city where there 's always music .
i think every time somebody ever , there 's a parade in new orleans .
in this city , some of the most beautiful buildings in the world , but it 's also the city with most abandoned reason in america .
i live near this house , and i was thinking about how i possibly can . and i thought about something that changed my life forever .
in 2009 , i lost someone i loved .
her name was joan , and she was like a mother for me , and her death came and unexpectedly and unexpectedly .
i 've been thinking a lot about death , and i felt a great gratitude for my life , and it taught me some of the things that i care about in life now .
but it 's hard for me to keep that perspective every day .
it 's easy to lose and forgetting what 's really important .
with the help of old and new friends , i transformed a side of the house into a giant chalk and wrote a tag on the gaps : " before i die , i want to die , " everybody who can pass by , can take a piece of chalk over his life and his own hope .
i wasn 't sure what i could expect with the experiment , but the next day , the wall was completely fill it up and she kept growing .
i want to share some sentences with you that were written by the people on the wall .
" before i die , i want to be accused of piracy . "
" before i die , i want to be standing wide on the international airport authority . "
" before i die , i want to sing for millions of people . "
" before i die , i want to plant a plant a plant . "
" before i die , i 'd like to live web zeitgeist . "
" before i die , i want to keep you in my poor . "
" before i die , i want to be a cavalry stage . "
" before i die , i want to be myself all myself . "
this neglect place became a meaningful place , and the hopes and dreams of people brought me laugh to laugh and cry and trays me during the hard times .
it 's about knowing that you 're not alone .
it 's about understanding our neighbors and it 's a new and revelally .
it 's about creating spaceness and thinking and remembering what we 're most important as we grow and change .
i 've done this last year , and i received hundreds of news stories of passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community , so my colleagues and i created a construction kit and are now built in the world like kazakhstan , south africa , australia , argentina and other walls .
we 've shown how much power our public places when we have the opportunity to share our voices and share more with others .
two of the most valuable things we have are time and the relationships to other people .
in a world with increasing distractions , it 's more important than ever before to look at things with the right look and think that life is short and sensitive .
we 're often stopped talking about death , or even just thinking about it , but i realized that the preparation for death is one of the things that empowers us most .
the idea of death strikes us the life .
our shared spaces are best to show us as individuals and as a community , and with more opportunities to share our hopes and stories , the people around us cannot only help us create better places , they can help us live better .
thank you .
thank you .
so , i 'm applied to applied mathematics , a special issue for anyone who deals with applied mathematics is that we 're like management consultant .
nobody knows what we actually do .
so today , i 'm going to try and tell you what i do .
dance is one of the most human activity .
we 're thrilled with the sight of champion and steady color , as you 're about to see .
the ballet is an extraordinary , a tremendous level of knowledge and skills , and possibly some basic e-based that could have a genetic component .
sadly , neurological causes neurological disorders such as parkinson 's got this extraordinary ability , and that 's what she does with my known , jansky , who was a ballet in his time .
over the years , a lot of progress in treatment .
yet there are six.3 million people around the world who suffer from this disease , and they have to face with the incurable malign such as weakness , treor , stiffness and others that causes this disease , so we need objective resources to discover the disease before it is too late .
we need to measure the progression that process , and ultimately , the only way to really know if there is healing , if we have an objective measure that question .
angry is that for parkinson 's disease and other movements don 't have a biomarkers , so you can 't do an easy blood cell analysis , and the best thing there 's this 20-minute test test test test .
you have to do it in the clinic . it 's very expensive , and that means , outside studies that 's never done that . it 's never done .
but what if patients could do this test home ?
that would save a trip to the hospital . what if patients could do this test themselves ?
it wouldn 't be an expensive eye care .
it costs 300 percent , by the way , to study himself in the neurological department .
so i 'd like to suggest to you a unconventional way that we 're trying to do that , because we 're all , at least in a certain sense , virtualized as my well- designer .
here you can see a video of vibrating strings .
that 's happening in healthy state , when someone 's generated , and we can look at as a coherent dancer , because we have to coordinate all these coherent organs , if we make sounds loud , and we all have the genes for it . so , for example .
and how ballet does it require a lot of exercise .
remember how long a child needs a child until talking .
by the loud , we can determine where the vibrating strings of vibrating , and as the limbs are also the sound effects of parkinson 's disease .
on the lower lip record , you can see an example of irregular vocal formation .
we always see the same symptoms .
voice 2or , weakness , stiffness .
the language is even lower and sometimes it 's an example of an example of it .
these impacts on the voice can be minimal , sometimes , but with digital microphones and precision medical software , combined with newly study , which is now very advanced , we can now find exactly where someone is in a scale between disease and health , only because of the date .
how can we measure these tests in clinical trials ? well , they 're both non-invasively . the test for neurologists .
very little . infrastructure is already there .
you don 't have to build new clinics for this .
and both are exactly . this is not being conducted by experts .
so you can be done by themselves .
they 're very fast , take 30 seconds .
they 're very cheap , and we know what that means .
if something 's extremely cheap , you can use it in large extent .
now these amazing goals we can achieve with this .
we can reduce logistical difficulty for patients .
patients don 't have to have routine control in the clinic .
we can get objective data by common observation .
we can do inexpensive masses of clinical trials , and for the first time we can be able to do this research all of the population .
we have now have the opportunity to look for the first for the disease before it 's too late .
today we do the first step in this direction , we 'll start the parkinson 's voice initiative .
by the trained and patient backs , we want to take a very high number of voices in the world to own enough data for achieving those goals .
we have minor numbers that are accessible to a billion people on this planet .
anyone who or without parkinson 's disease can be favorable to leave images for a few cents . i 'll admit that we 've already reached six percent of our goal in just eight hours .
thank you .
if you take samples of , say , 10,000 people , you can say who 's healthy and who doesn 't ?
what you 'll do with all these specimens ?
what happened is that the patient 's patient has to disclose whether this person has to suffer or not . ok .
some may not be able to finish it .
but we collect a huge database , under different circumstances , which is interesting . these conditions are important , because we 're looking at those out ofor to realize what the markers of parkinson 's disease .
right now , your 86 percent accuracy of 86 percent accuracy ?
it 's much better .
my students 's point of mind -- i have to praise him because he 's done so fantastic work -- now shown that it also works on the cell network , which enabled this project , and we 're 99 percent accuracy .
this is what i call an improvement .
that means that people can -- people can call with a mobile phone and do the test . people could call parkinson 's disease , let their voice , so that your doctor can check the progress of the disease .
right .
thank you . maxle , ladies and gentlemen  ⁇ 
thank you , tom .
here i live . i live in kenya on the southern edge of the nairobi , and i live in kenya .
in the background you see my father 's cows , and the cows behind the cows is the nairobi park .
nairobi park is only in the south places , and it means that wildlife can leave the park anywhere .
the predators , the lion , follow them . and then they do this .
they kill our livestock .
this is one of our cows that was killed at night , and i woke up in the morning and found it was dead . it was awful . it was our only cop cop .
my tribe , the maas 's tribe , believe that we came together with our animals and the sight of the sky , so our animals mean so much .
as a child , i learned to hate lions .
our warrior morans . they protect our tribe and our herds , and they 're also upset about this problem .
and kill the lions .
here 's one of six lions killed in nairobi .
and i think that 's why in the nairobi , there 's only so few lions .
in my tribe , a young between six and nine years , it 's responsible for the cows of his father , and so i did .
i had to find a solution .
my first idea was fire . lions fear fire .
but then i realized that this wouldn 't really help us , but help the lions to see the cows better .
but i wasn 't up . i kept on .
i had a second idea . i tried it with a bird- scare .
i wanted the lion thought , i was next to the cow shank .
but lions are very bright animals .
you come , you see the birds coming back and go again , but the next time you come and say the thing doesn 't move , that 's still there .
and they reach and killing our livestock .
one night i imagined the stable . i was walking with a torch around him and this time the lion doesn 't respond .
lion is afraid of light moving .
i had an idea .
as a little boy , i worked all day in my room , and even the new radio my mom 's new radio , and that day she almost took me around , but i had learned a lot about electronics .
i took an old car battery , and i took a poster out of a motorcycle . it shows if you want to turn right or left . it 's flashing .
and i got a switch to shut down the lights and turn off .
this is a little pear from a broken flashlight .
and then i put it all together .
the solar panel charge the battery that battery power to the battery power , and i call it a transformational .
and the bellwether signs is flashing .
you can see that the birke look outwards , because of where the lions come the lions .
and this is what it looks like for the lions when they come .
the lights and the lions believe i go around the barn , and i was in bed all the time .
thank you .
i 've been installing this at home , and since then , we had no more problems with lions .
and then our neighbors heard about it .
one of them was this grandmother .
she had lost a lot of their animals and she asked me if i could install their lights .
and i said , " yes . "
i installed the lights . you can see the lions in the background .
since then , i 've got seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights , and they worked really well .
my idea is now used in kenya , for other predators like hyenas or leopards . the lights are also used to keep the elephants from remote farms .
my invention turned to me to one of the best schools in kenya , brook international school , and i 'm really excited .
my new school is committed and helping fundraising and education and education .
i even brought my friends with home , and together we install the lights where there is no one yet , and i 'm showing people how to use it .
just a year ago , i was just a boy from the savanna , his father 's cows . i saw airplanes , and i said , " one day i 'm going to sit in one  ⁇  "
and here i stand here .
i was allowed me with an airplane , for my first tedtalk .
if i 'm big , i want to be an airplane and a pilot . that 's my big dream .
i used to hated lions . but through my invention , i can save my father 's cows and the lions . we can share , side with the lions , with no argument .
ash ⁇  ol ⁇ n . in my language means that : thank you very much .
you don 't know how exciting it is to hear a story like your listening .
so you have this scholarship . yeah . yeah .
you work on other electrical innovation .
what 's the next on the list ?
my next invention , now , i work on an electric fence . an electric fence ?
yes , i know , electrical fences are already invented , but i want to have my own .
you tried it once , not true -- yeah , i 've tried it before , but try again , because i got a blow .
it 's hard . richard turin , you 're very special .
we 're going to measure you at every step of your journey , my friend .
thank you very much . thank you .
since i 'm old enough to hold a camera in my hand , photography is my passion . but today i want to share with you 15 of my favorite pictures , and no one of them i 've done .
there was no art directors , no such lists , no opportunity to shoot an image . not even the lighting was taken .
to be honest , most of them were shot by random tourists .
my story starts when i was for a lecture in new york , and my wife made this picture i gave my daughter on her first birthday on my arm , and we were on the corner of 5 ⁇  5 ⁇  and five .
just a year later , we were back in new york , and so we decided to shoot the same picture again .
well , you can see where this is going ...
when my daughter 's third birthday party , my wife said , " hey , why don 't you plan to new york , and it 's a father-daughter trip to lead the ritual ? "
at the time , we started asking ourselves by running tourists , to make a picture of us .
you know , it 's remarkable how universal the gesture is if you get a complete stranger .
no one has ever said no , and fortunately , no one 's never being cut through our camera .
then we didn 't know how much these journeys would change our lives .
this journey has become very sacred .
this one was taken only weeks after 9  ⁇  11 , and i had to explain what happened on the day so that a five-year-old can understand it .
these images are much more than just a moment , or a particular journey .
they 're also a way for us to stop for a week in october and time and how we change from year to year not only physically but to reflect on everything .
because although we 're always doing the same picture , our perspective shifts from time , as they always reach new milestones , i can see life with their eyes , how they deal with everything , and how it sees it .
this very intense time that we spend with each other is something that we value and expect and expect every year .
recently , while one of our travel , we went for a walk , and all of a sudden it stopped , it shows up to a red ink marks on a puppet store which they used as a little kid at the previous traveling .
and she told me about her feelings that she had been given as a five-year-olds at that point .
she said she remembered as her heart jumped out of the chest , nine years ago when she first saw the store the store for the first time .
and now she looks up in new york , because she 'd necessarily want to study in new york .
and i realized , the most important thing we all create are memories .
and so i 'd like to share with you the idea of taking an active role in the conscious of memories .
i don 't know what it looks like you , but besides these 15 images , i 'm not on a family photo .
i 'm always who makes the picture .
i want to encourage everyone of you today to come to the image and hesitation not ask someone , " would you make a picture of us ? "
thank you very much .
