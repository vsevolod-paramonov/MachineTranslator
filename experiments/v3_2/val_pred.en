when i was 11 years old , one morning , i was hit by the sounds of sound pouring in the morning .
my father listened to his little , gray radio show the bbc 's location on the bbc .
he looked very happy , which was quite unusual then , because the news was usually depressing .
he called , " the taliban are gone  ⁇  "
i didn 't know what that meant , but it obviously made my father was very , very happy .
" now you can go to a real school , " he said .
this morning i will never forget that morning .
a real school .
the taliban moved power in afghanistan when i was six , and banned girls to go to school .
so for five years , i would dress up being a boy , and my older sister who had no longer want to go alone to a secret school .
only that 's how we could both go to school .
every day we took another way , so nobody could guess where we went .
we hidden our books in shopping bags , so it looked like we 're just walk shop .
we were taught in a house , over 100 girls in a small living room .
it was comfort , but in summer , it was incredibly hot .
we all knew that we risked our lives : teachers , students and our parents and our parents .
and again , the class had to fall for a week , because the taliban had suspicion .
we never knew how much they knew about us .
so are they us ?
did you know where we live ?
we were scared , but we still wanted to go to school .
i 've been very lucky in a family where education were considered important and daughters have been appreciated .
my grandfather was far ahead of his time .
an outsider from a remote province . he insisted to send his daughter -- my mother -- to school and was sent from his father .
my educated mother but became a teacher .
that 's her .
two years ago , she went to retire our house in a school for girls and women from the neighborhood .
and my father -- to see here -- was the first one in his family who ever received an education .
for him , he was clear that his children would get education , even his daughters , despite the taliban , despite all risks .
he looked at it as a much greater risk of sending his children to school .
i still know that in the years under the taliban have been so frustrated by our lives , by the constant fear and the shift .
that i had good lust to quit , but my father said , " daughter , listen to me . you can lose everything in your life .
your money can be stolen . you can be displaced in the war in your house .
but one of the things will always stay : what 's in here , and even if we have to pay with our blood for your school fees , we 'll do that .
so -- you still want to give up ? "
today i am 22 years old .
i grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war .
less than six percent of my age , women have completed a higher degree than the secondary degree , and if my family had not been used so much for my education , i would be one of those women .
instead , i 'm standing here today , as a proud owner of the mid-degree college .
when i returned to afghanistan , my grandfather , who was being violated by his family because he managed to send his daughters to school , one of the first one who sent me .
and he 's not just with my graduate student , but also with me that i was the first woman , and he 's driving him through the car .
my family thinks of me .
i have big dreams , but my family still has greater dreams for me .
so i 'm a global ambassador for 10x10 , one campaign for the education of women .
that 's why i 've helped to create soloa , the first and perhaps the only boarding school for girls in afghanistan , a country where girls ' school was still risky for girls .
it 's wonderful to see how the students at my school with great ambitious all of you want to perceive opportunities .
and to see her parents and fathers once stand for them , as did my parents for me , despite all against all the transcripts .
like ahmed ahmed . this is not his real name , and i can 't show his face , but ahmed the father is one of my students .
a month ago , his daughter , and he was on the way home office in her village , and they 're death by a bomb on the side by just a few minutes .
when he came home , the phone rings and a voice told him if he sent his daughter on to school , they would try again .
he said , " now , if you want me , but i 'm not going to put the future of my daughter to play because of your ancient , ancient ideas . "
in afghanistan , i realized something that is often dismissed in the west , which is behind most of us who have succeeded , a father who recognizes the value of his daughter and aware that your success is also success .
that doesn 't mean that our mothers don 't matter important role in our success .
in fact , they 're the ones who start to confront and convincing a promising future of their daughters , but in a society like afghanistan , the support of men is vital .
under the taliban , a few hundred girls went to school -- because it was illegal .
but today in afghanistan over three million girls in the school bank .
afghanistan appears , from america looks so different .
the americans recognize how insecure such changes are .
i 'm afraid that the changes are not long and the trigger for the u.s. troops will change everything .
but when i 'm in afghanistan , when i see the students in my school , and their parents who encourage you to encourage , i see a promising future and a long-lasting change .
afghanistan , for me , is a country of hope and boundless opportunities , and remember every day , every day , the girls who go to the solara .
just like i have big dreams .
thank you .
everything i do , including my life -- was being shaped by seven years of work in africa as a young man .
from 19 ⁇ 1 to 19 ⁇  -- i look young , but i don 't -- -- -- i 've been in zambia , kenya , ivory , kenya and somalia , somalia and somalia projects on technical collaboration with african countries .
i worked for an italian ngo and every single project that we put onto the legs , failed .
i was desperate .
i , 21 years , i thought that we 're good people are good people and good work in africa .
instead , we killed everything we did .
our first project , which my first book , " rifles of the zambles , " inspired one where we wanted to show people sam 's people like food .
we came with italy in southern poverty ; in this amazing valley , which leads to sam di market , and we taught the local population of the growing tomato and tocadc and ...
of course , the local absolutely had no interest in this , so we paid them working for this , and sometimes they hit them .
we were amazed that there was no agricultural valley in such a fertile agricultural valley .
but instead of asking why they didn 't grow anything , we simply said , " thank god that we are here  ⁇  "
" just in time to save people sambias against starvation . "
of course , everything wonderfully wonderful in africa .
we had this magnificent tomato . in italy , they were so large , in zambia so big .
we couldn 't believe it , and we said , " look how easy agriculture is . "
when the tomatoes were ripe and red , overnight , about 200 feet from the river and down everything .
and we said to the samb : " oh god , the nile  ⁇  "
and they said , " yes , so we don 't have agriculture here . "
" why didn 't you say this ? " you never asked us . "
i just thought we were so great in africa , but then i saw what the americans did , what the english did , what the french did . after seeing what they did , i became quite proud of our project .
at least we feed at least the nile care .
you should see the nonsense -- -- you should see the nonsense that we haven 't benefited on the african people .
you should read the book " dead aid , " from there 's a samburial economist .
the book was published in 2009 .
we 've developed the african continent 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years .
i 'm not going to tell you what this money has done .
just read your book .
read from an africanin , what we 've been doing .
we are western people are imperialists , colonialists , mission , and there are only two ways we deal with people . we pat them or we 're patriarchal .
both words come from the latin root " father , " which means " father . "
but they have two different meanings .
patrice : i keep each other 's culture as if they were my children . " i love you so much . "
patisante : i keep each of another culture as if they were my servant .
that 's why white people in africa are called belaana , called boss .
i was harassed when i read the book , " smallness , " written by schum , " he said , especially in the economy of economics , if people don 't want help , they leave .
this should be the first principle of help .
the first principle of aid is respect .
this morning , the gentleman came up with this conference , put a pole on the floor and said , " can you imagine a city that 's not neo-built ? "
when i was 2 ⁇  years old , i decided to only react to people , and created a system called business , where never gets anything , no one is motivated , but you become a service of the local authority that the servant of the local people who have a better person .
what you do -- you keep your mouth .
you never achieve a community of ideas , you sit with the local people .
we don 't work from offices .
we meet in cafes . we meet in pubs .
we have no infrastructure .
we close friendships and figure out what the person wants to do .
the most important is passion .
you can give someone an idea .
if that person doesn 't like that person , what do you do ?
the passion for your own growth of the person is the most important .
the passion for its own growing is the most important of humanity .
we help them find the knowledge , because nobody alone can be successful .
the person with the idea may not have the idea , but it 's available .
many years ago , i had this simple thing : why , instead of coming to a community and tell people what to do , why don 't we listen to them ? but not in a community meeting .
let me tell you a secret .
there 's a problem with a communityver .
entrepreneurs never have part of them , and you 'll never say publicly , what you want to do with your money , what choices you see .
planning has this blind spot .
the smartest people of the community don 't know , because they never appear to public public .
we 're working one to do this , we need to be created a social infrastructure that doesn 't exist .
a new job has to be created .
this is the doctor of the company , the house of the operating room who 's sitting in the house , sitting on her kitchen table and in the cafe , helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a way of transforming life .
i 've tried this in it 's in the western australia , western australia .
i worked at the time , trying to get down the drop-up , where we tell others what to do to escape .
i helped these five fishermen to work together and not sell this wonderful tuna on a factory in albania for 60 cents  ⁇  pounds , but after japan for 15 dollars for three dollars , and then farmers came to me and said , " hey , you helped them ? "
in a year , i had 2 ⁇  projects . the government came to ask me , " how do you do that ?
how do you do ... ? " i said , " i do something very , very difficult .
i keep the mouth and i listen to them . "
so -- so the government says , " do it again . "
we 've done it in 300 communities around the world .
we 've helped 100,000 companies at the startup .
there 's a new generation of companies that flows on loneliness .
peter printer , one of the best companies 's story , died with 96 years ago .
peter printer was a philosophy professor before he studied businesses . peter printer said , planning is actually incompatible with an entrepreneurial society and economics . "
planning is the death of the entrepreneurial life of the entrepreneurial life .
so , you build christchurch , without knowing what the smartest person is going to do with their money and their energy .
you have to learn how to get them to get you .
you have to give them private and privacy . you have to be great in helping them , and they will come in .
in a community of 10,000 people , we get 200 customers .
can you imagine a community of 400 people , intelligence and passion ?
what 's the presentation you most applaud this morning ?
local , passionate people . these have them are applauding .
i want to say that entrepreneurship is the right way .
we 're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- it 's not a viable fossil fuels , manufacturing -- and suddenly there are systems that aren 't sustainable .
the burn power machine is not sustainable .
but maintaining maintain is unsustainable .
we need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways , cure , transport , transport , transport and can transport them .
the technologies don 't exist for it .
who 's going to invent this technology for the green revolution ? universities ? forget about it  ⁇ 
government ? forget it  ⁇ 
it will be entrepreneurs . and you 'll do it already now .
i read a beautiful story in a futuristic magazine many years ago .
there was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of new york city in 186000 .
in 1860 , they came together and spoke of what would happen in 100 years with the city of new york , and the conclusion was unity : new york would no longer exist in 100 years .
why ? they looked at the curve and they said , if the population is growing at this pace , they needed six million horses to get people , and it would be impossible to deal with the crap of six million horses .
because they went under the crap .
in 1860s the dirty technology that life sucks life from new york .
what happens ? 40 years later , 1900 , in the united states , 1001 million car -- 1001 .
the idea of finding another technology , had done this race . there were tiny little factories in the h .
de acorn , michigan . henry ford .
there 's a secret to work with entrepreneurs .
first of all , you have to be a private report .
otherwise , they don 't come and talk to them .
next , you have to offer you absolute , dedicated and passionate service service .
then you have to tell you the absolute truth about entrepreneurship .
from the smallest till the biggest company , all need to be able to do is perform three things : to sell the product needs to be grand , the market needs to be grand and the financial crisis .
guess what ?
we 've never met a single person who can produce at the same time selling and sell around the money .
that doesn 't exist .
this person never was born .
we 've done research , and we looked at the 100 iconic companies in the world -- carnegie , west , edison , ford , the new companies , google , google , yahoo .
there 's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have owned , only one : no one was founded by just one person .
now we teach 16-year-old in north country entrepreneurship , and we start teaching education to give you the first two sides of richard branson , and the task of 16-year-olds , it 's in the first two sides of richard branson , how often he used the word " me , "
never " i " and 32 times " we . "
he wasn 't alone when he started .
no one set up a company alone . nobody did .
so we can create a community in the facilitator who have a small entrepreneur , in cafes and bars and bars , and they 're going to do for you , what anybody did for this gentleman who talks about this epic . somebody who will say , " what do you need ? "
what can you do ? can you make it ?
okay , can you sell it ? can you pay the money ? "
" oh , no , i can 't . " " you want me to find somebody for you ? "
we activate communities .
we have groups of volunteers who support companies to support organizations to help them find the resources and people , and we 've found that the wonder of the local people 's intelligence community can change the culture and the economy of this community can only be transformed by the moving of passion , energy and imagination .
thank you .
five years ago , i learned how it must be to be alice in wonderland .
the penn state university , i was asked -- a lecture for communications -- aspiring engineers in communication to communicate .
i was scared .
fear . fear of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big books and their big , i don 't trusted words .
but when the conversation developed , it occurred to me like alice when she can go down to the guinea farming and saw a door to a whole new world .
likewise , when i was talking to the students , and i was amazed about the thoughts they had and wanted others to visit this wonder .
i think to open this door , it requires great communication .
we really need great communication of our scientists and engineers to change the world .
because our scientists and engineers are the ones who understand our biggest problems , like energy , environmental and health , and if we don 't know about it , and it 's not going to go forward . i think it 's in our responsibility as non- scientist , these conversations .
but these great conversations don 't come true when our scientists and engineers don 't invite us in their wonderland .
so scientists and engineers , please , we 're up to us .
i want to show you a couple of approaches how you can do it , that we can see that science and technology that you 're doing , sexy and interesting .
the first question you need to answer is : well ?
tell us why your scientific area is so relevant to us .
it 's not just telling us that their trapezbe , but also tells us that you 're putting on her own pack , the skin texture in our bones because it 's important to understand osteoporosis and treat osteopor .
and if you 're telling what you do , you avoid technical words .
technical words are an obstacle to understand your mind .
surely you could use " space and time and time , " but why don 't you just say " space and time , " what is much more exciting for us ?
to understand your thoughts of understanding of your mind is not the same as your level down .
as einstein said , " do things as simple as possible -- but not simpler . "
you can tell us a little bit about your scientific area , without having to impose tradeoffs .
a few things are also to consider : examples , stories and analogies , in this way , you can pull us in your spell .
and if you presented your work , let the spots away .
have you ever wondered why it 's called down point ?
what happens when someone punch it ? another one 's going to pick up , and the first person will tell your audience .
a slide like this is not just boring , but also turns too much on the language processing part of our brain , and so we 're rapidly overwhelmed .
this example of genes of genes of genes brown is much more potent , and it shows that the special structure of the tract is so stable that it was even the inspiration for the unique design of the eiffel tower .
the trick here is to use a single , easy phrase that the audience , when it loses the thread , will use imagery and uses our other senses that creates a deeper understanding of what you 're describing .
these are just a few approaches that can help us open this door and see the wonderland that science and the technology in the mountains .
since the engineers i 've taught , taught me to connect with the  ⁇  nerd in me , i want to summarize everything with an equation .
pull off your science and raise your technical words and your technical words , divide this by relevance , so the audience , which is important , and multiply all of this with the passion you have for your incredible work : and that 's how unimaginable is full of new insights .
so scientists and engineers , if you 've solved this equation , it 's necessarily me .
thank you .
hi . that 's my phone .
a cell phone can change a life and give a personal freedom .
with a cell phone , you can film a crime in humanity in syria .
with a cell phone , you can tweet a message , and you start a protest in egypt in egypt .
and with a cell phone , you can record a song , upload it at sound production and famous .
all of this is possible with a cell phone .
i 'm a year of 1984 and live in berlin .
let 's go back into this city at that time .
you can see how hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of thousands of people went down the street and demonstrated .
we are in the fall in 1989 , and we imagine that all these people who were standing up and changing changes , had a cell phone in the pocket .
who in the room has a cell phone ?
hold it up .
hold your cell phones up , hold it up  ⁇ 
hold it up . an android , a blackberry , wow , wow .
that 's a lot . almost everybody has a cell phone today .
but today i want to talk about me and my cell phone and how it changed my life .
and i 'm going to talk about this .
this is 35.8,830s data is full information .
raw raw .
and why is this information there ?
because in the summer of 2006 , the e.u.u. budget has set a policy .
this policy is called the policy storage bill system .
this policy is that every telephone company in europe , every internet service providers in europe , needs to store a bandwidth to store a bandwidth .
who 's calling who ? who 's sending an email ?
who 's sending a text ?
and if you use a cell phone where you are .
all of this information is saved for at least six months to two years from your telephone company or your internet service providers .
and everywhere in europe , people got up and said , " we don 't want it . "
they said , we don 't want to have to have to have to have to have this procedure data storage .
we want to self-determination in the digital age , and we don 't want the telephone companies and the internet services all this information about us .
there were lawyers , journalists , priests , priests , everybody said , " we don 't want that . "
and here you can see how tens of tens of tens of tens of tens of tens of tens of tens of tens of tens of tens of thousands of people go to the streets of berlin and said , " freedom instead of fear . "
and some people even said this could be a stm 2.0 .
the stasis was the secretaries in eastern germany .
and i also wonder whether that really works .
can they really store all this information about us ?
every time i use my cell phone ?
so i asked my telephone company , the german factory that was then the largest telephone company in germany , and i asked her , please send me all the information you saved me .
and i asked her once and i asked her again , and she didn 't get the right answer . except empty pepsi .
but then i said to myself , i want this information , because it 's my life that you 're being there .
so i decided to launch a court- court , because i wanted this information .
but the german gombs said , no , we 're not going to give you this information .
at the end , it came to a comparison with them .
i pulled back the charges , what they were asking me to send information .
because in the meanwhile , the federal national dish decided that the introduction of the e.u.u , the german line was sent to the german .
so i got this ugly brown little brown paper with a cd .
and on the cd , this was this .
35.8,30 lines of information .
first of all , i saw it , and i said to me , well , it 's a huge file . i can .
but then i realized after a while , this is my life .
this is six months of my life in this file .
so i was a little bit skeptical , what should i start with it ?
because you can see where i am , where i sleep at night , what i do .
but then i said , i want to go to the public with this information .
i want to make them publication .
because i want to show people what 's required prior to supply people what 's happening in front of this data means .
so over time and open data city , i did this .
this is a visualization of six months of my life .
you can zoom in and pull out , you can rewind and forth and forth .
you can take every step i do , track .
and you can even see how i drive from frankfters with the train crash , and how many calls i do on the way .
all of this is possible through this information .
that makes a little bit scared .
but it 's not just me .
it 's all of us .
first of all , i call my wife and she calls me , and we 're talking a few times .
and then a few friends call me and they call each other .
and after a while they call them and they call them , and we have this huge network network network .
but you can see how people communicate with each other , at which time they call each other when they go to bed .
you can see it all .
you see the central figures , about who are the leaders of the group .
if you have access to that information , you can see what society is doing .
if you have access to that information , you can control society .
this is a blueprint for countries like china and iran .
this is the perfect design of how to monitor a society , because you know who talks to who sends who an email , all this is possible if you have access to this information .
and that information is stored for at least six months in europe to two years .
as i said to start , we imagine that all of these people in the streets of berlin , in the fall in the fall of 1989 cell phones in their pocket .
and the authorities had known , who was at the demonstration , and if the people had the leaders who had been the leaders , it might have never happened .
the fall of the berlin wall may not occurred .
and it 's not the case of the iron curtain .
because today 's government agencies and companies want to store so much information as they can get over us , online and offline .
they want to have the opportunity to pursue our lives , and they want to store it for all long .
but self-determination and life in digital age are not a contradiction .
however , you have to fight for your own decisions today .
you have to fight every day .
so when you go home , tell your friends that privacy is a 21st century , and this is not old .
when you go home , you say your deputy , just because companies and government places have the opportunity to store specific information , you don 't have to do it long .
and if you don 't believe me , ask your phone company about the information you 've stored .
so , in the future every time you use your cell phone , remember that you have to struggle for your self-determination in the digital age .
thank you .
i live in south central central .
this is south central : the name 's h. central grocery stores , fast food , break .
so the urban planners are meeting , and he was thinking about changing the name of central central to something else , so they changed it in south los angeles as if that 's something going wrong in the city .
this is south los angeles .
the name should go to sleep , fast food restaurants , break free .
as 26.5 million other americans live in the food desert in central los angeles , the home of the drive-tus and the drive .
the funny thing is that the drive-tactic people kill more people than the drive-shaped .
people are dying in south central los angeles to poor diseases .
for example , obesity rate in my neighborhood is higher than about beverly hills , which is roughly 15 kilometers away .
i couldn 't see that anymore .
and i wondered how you would feel if they didn 't have access to healthy food if you went out of the house , the negative impact that the existing food system on their neighborhood .
i enlightened that wheelchairs are bought and they 'll be sold like use devices .
i see the dialysis centers shooting at night watch as starbucks .
and i realized that must stop .
i 've got the problem is the solution .
food is the problem and food is the solution .
also , i didn 't feel more on 45-minute walk score to get an apple that 's not covered with pesticides .
so , i planted a food-shirt front of my house .
it 's a piece of land that we call park park .
it 's 45 feet .
the thing is , it 's the city .
but you have to care .
so i think , " cool . i can do what i want because it 's my responsibility and i have to stand it in stand . "
and i decided to hold it that way .
so i and my group , the l.a. green ground , together and we started to eat my food forest , and fruit trees , the whole program , vegetables .
we 're a kind of a binary group , and it 's from gardening from all of the social strata , and from all the city , it 's completely voluntary and everything we do , is free .
and the garden is beautiful .
but then someone complained .
the city came up to me , and he basically gave me a charge and said that i 've got to remove my garden that became a judge .
and i thought , " come on , real ?
a judge of regulations for growing food on a piece of land that doesn 't matter completely ? "
and i thought , " cool . here we go . "
because this time it wouldn 't rise .
the l.a. times had wind of it , and steve l wait a story about it , and talked to the city council , and with a member of green ground , and she wrote a petitioned petitioned.org , and with 900 below we succeeded .
we stopped the victory in the hands .
my city council even called it , and said they support it and love what we do .
so , really , why shouldn 't you do that ?
l.a. in the united states , most of the billboards in the city .
they have three-and-foot clear cutting sheets .
these are 20 central park .
this is enough land to plant  ⁇ 25 million tomato plants .
why the hell should you shouldn 't find that ok ?
you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seed plant from the plant , you get 1,000 seeds .
with green beans in the value of a dollar you get fruit and vegetables worth  ⁇ 5 dollars .
it 's my savior operation , i 'm telling people to grow their own food .
its own food is how to print your own money .
see , i have a legacy in central central .
i grew up there . i raised my sons there .
and i refuse to be part of this preconceived reality that was made by other people , and i make my own reality .
see , i 'm an artist .
garden art is my graffiti . i plant my art .
just like a graffiti artists who 's walking the walls , i quit my lawns and parks plants .
i use the garden , the earth , like a piece of stuff , and the plants and the trees are my hunting for these stuff .
you would be surprised what the ground can do if you use it as a canvas .
you can 't imagine how amazing a sunflower is , and how it touches people .
so what happened ?
i have experienced my garden became an instrument for education and the transformation of my neighborhood .
to change the community , you have to change the composition of the floor .
we are the soil .
they were going to wonder about how children are being affected .
gardening is the therapeutic and most audacious act that you can do , especially in the middle of the city .
furthermore , you get strawberries .
and i remember this time this time this mother and her daughter came , it was about 10 : 30 per night . they were in my garden , and i came out and they looked so embarrassed .
i was really bad because they were there , and i told them , " you know , you don 't have to do that .
the garden is not without reason on the street . "
i 've been ashamed of when i saw people who were so close to me , and that 's just empowered me to do that . people said , " fin , you 're not afraid that people will steal your food . "
and i said , " the hell , no , i 'm not afraid they 're claws .
it 's actually on the street .
that 's the idea .
i want you to take it , but at the same time , i want you to take your health . "
at another time , i put a garden in this floor in downtown l.a .
these are the guys who helped me take the truck .
it was cool , and they shared their stories about how it affects them and how they planted with her mother and her grandmother , and it was great to see how it changed if it might just for a moment .
we 've been building about 20 gardens in the ground has been around 20 gardens .
so 50 people came and our surrounding and this is all volunteers .
when kids grow ushahidi grow , children grow kids .
if you grow tomatoes , you eat tomato tomatoes .
but if you 're not offered any of it , if you didn 't show them how food and body affects , they 're blind , whatever you do .
i see young people who want to work , but they 're stuck in this thing -- i see colored kids who are right on the path that they 're supposed to be , and who 's nowhere to go anywhere .
the gardening classes , i see as an opportunity where we can train these children to take care of their communities to take a sustainable life .
and when we do , who knows ?
we could make the next george washington carver .
but if we don 't change the composition of the ground , we 'll never will .
so this is one of my plans . that 's what i want to do .
i want to plant a whole apartment block to plants where people can share the food in the same block .
i want to take shipping container and turn them into healthy cafe .
so , don 't get me wrong .
i 'm not talking about free fuck , because free is unsustainable .
the funny thing about sustainability is you have to keep it through it .
i 'm talking about giving people work , and bring kids from the streets , and they get the joy of getting pride and the honor of letting their own food , and when you open farmers markets .
so what i want to do here is to make this sexy .
i want us to become all of the ecological rebels , gangster , gear .
we have to flip the image of gang star .
if you 're not a gardeners , you 're not a gangster .
gangster is , you 're going to do with " nerdy shovel , right ?
and let the weapon of your choice .
if you want to meet with me , don 't call me in a comfortable chairs and want to do a meeting where you talk about making fun .
if you want to meet me , come with your shovels , in my backyard so that we can make any plants .
peace . thank you . thank you .
thank you . thank you .
one of my favorite words in the whole oxford english dictionary is " snarenski . "
because it sounds beautiful .
and " snares of snares " means " an dishonest politicians . "
although a newspaper editor in the 19th century a newspaper editor has a better definition : " a snares of a pill is someone who 's trying to run an office , independently of party , program or conductive , and its success through the sheer forces of monument to the cool noise . "
i have no idea what language is .
something in words , i think .
but it 's very important that words at the center of politics , and all politicians know that they need to try to control language .
in 1 ⁇ 1 ⁇ 1 , for example , according to the british parliament , newspapers , they couldn 't really understand the exact opposite of the debates of the debates .
and this actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary names of crohn 's called the parliament who used to reflect on the parliament .
they threw it in the tower of london and placed him , but he was brave enough , he was brave enough , he was brave enough , and finally he had so much support in london he won .
and just a few years later , we 'll find the first evidence for the sentence as strong as roaring . many believe .
brigha refer to the word for tin word for tin .
but that 's not true . it goes back to a proponent of press freedom of freedom of freedom .
but to show you how words and policy makers are intertwined , i want to take you in the u.s. , at the time she has just reached independence .
you looked at the question of how to ask george washington , the head of state , call the head of state .
you didn 't know .
how do you call the leader of a republican nation ?
and that 's been edited about this in congress .
and there were all sorts of possible suggestions .
i mean , some people wanted to call him governor washington , and others , his majesty george washington , and again , others , protecting the freedom of the united states of america 's united states of washington .
it 's not that memorable .
some people just wanted to call him king .
they thought that that 's actually works .
they weren 't monarch butterfly , they wanted to choose the king for a certain amount of time .
it could have worked .
but everybody was amazing bored because this debate was three weeks .
i 've read the diary of a senator 's journal , who 's always writes , " still the same topic . "
the reason for the delay and boredom was that the kansas house was against the senate .
the representatives didn 't want washington is going to be power . they didn 't want it .
king call , and probably give him to ideas to its focus .
they wanted to give him the most fun , most fierce , pathetic most pathetic titles that they could think .
this title was president .
president . they didn 't invent the title . it only existed before , but it only meant someone of a meeting .
something like the front of a jury .
he had no more size than the term " on superintendent " or " in the passport . "
sometimes there were presidents of small empireer and government groups , but it was really a trivial title .
so the senate refused to drop .
they said , " this is ridiculous , you can 't call him president .
this guy has to sign treaty and the foreign actors would meet .
who 's going to take him seriously , if he 's got a stupid little title like president of america 's united states of america ? "
and after three weeks debate , the senate didn 't give up .
you can learn three interesting things .
first of all , and i think that 's the best -- until now i haven 't found if the senate has ever predicted the president 's ever mentioned .
barack obama , president obama , has just borrowed the title , just waiting for the senate becomes active .
second , you can learn that if a government says something is temporary -- -- -- then 223 years later .
third , and that 's really important , that 's the most important point , is that the president of the united states of america today doesn 't sound that humility , right ?
this has to do with something more than 5,000 nuclear warheads that he has and the largest economy of the world and a fleet-size drones and all this stuff .
reality and history have given the title size .
and so the senate won at the end .
you 've got a respectful title .
and the other concern of the senate , which seems to be self-interest -- well , back then it was .
but do you know how many nations have a president ?
14 ⁇  .
because they all want to sound like the guy with the 5,000 nuclear warheads , etc .
so at the end , the senate , and she lost the representatives , because no one feels like when you 're told you 're now the president of the united states of america .
and this is the most important thing you can take , and i 'm going to leave you with .
politicians try to use words to shape reality and control reality , but actually the reality changes much more than words could ever change reality .
thank you .
so i came to a truck with about 50 rebels in combat in fighting a dreude to a 19-year-old , vegetarianism , florida , florida .
i traded my black-based , half-hackles against a few brown leather sander and fire was a rocket towards the government 's administration that i couldn 't even see .
this was the first time i was in afghanistan .
for a long time before that , i 'd grown up with the war , but next to pythagoras and football players and football games on sams and hunting with racist enactment nation and religious scholars , the u.s.v. , and long term , and if you lived in the natural world , and a time .
but that 's the geography of self .
and so i stand here , educated , southern afghanistan , south-states of god , an atheist and a radically different poli artist who lived for the last nine years and created .
so , there are many great things about art that you could do art , but i personally don 't like rain . i want to do art that i want to mess the personality and challenge and challenge and balancing the reality of the reality and actually uses a kind of fantasy to try to use the world .
i want to spend a day in the life of jihad , who used his jihadists like " pop records " audenstein and religious practices and political corruption to enrich himself .
and what else can the jihad do , than to run for parliament and make a choice campaign with the slogan , " choose me  ⁇  i do jihad and i am rich . "
and try to use this campaign to take this mafiosi , who spend on as national hero .
i want to go to corruption in afghanistan , and i want to go to the ground with a project called " recovery , " where you take a cop , a false check , on the streets of kabul and build cars , but instead of taking bribes from you to take money , and give them money , and ask yourself in fact , and tell you and a lot of the interest , and if you are
i want to look at how the conflict in afghanistan in my opinion has become the " modular conflict . "
the war and the stranger who came with him , created a new environment for st style and fashion that you can only capture a fashion , a fashion arena for soldiers and suicide bombers in which i would send out of fellow rwandan artists with a coast , if you can go in a row or a couple of players .
and i 'd like to see how a simple push from kabul from kabul between 1899 looks like 1899 to create a dialogue about how today 's development , their roots went into early stages across  ⁇  the burden of man , " to have the brown man , " to avoid the brown man themselves .
but for all of these things , you can come to jail , they can be misunderstood , misinformation .
but i do it because i have to , because the geography of self demands it demands .
that 's my load . what is yours ?
thank you .
hi . my name is cameron russell , and for a while i 've been a model .
for 10 years , exactly said .
and i feel that this is now in the room building an extraordinary tension , because i shouldn 't wear this dress .
fortunately , i have a little bit more to do that .
this is the first time someone checking on the ted stage , so you can appreciate seeing that , i think .
if a couple of women were really startled when i came out , you don 't need to tell me now , i 'll read later on twitter .
i also realize that i 'm pretty privileged , because i can change what you think of me .
that 's not everybody has the chance .
these paragraphs are very uncomfortable , it 's good that i didn 't want to wear them anyway .
the hardest part is to pull the sweater over my head , because then you all get me laugh , so nothing , unless he 's over my head .
all right .
why did i do this now ?
that was embarrassing .
now , hopefully it was not as embarrassing as this picture .
a image is powerful , but a image is also a image is also superficial .
i 've just changed their opinion from me in six seconds .
and in this picture -- i never really had a friend .
and i felt very uncomfortable , and the photographer told me i should have to hold my back , and with my hand into the hair 's hair .
and apart from surgeries or the wrongness , which i used to do two days ago for the work , there 's very few opportunities to change our external rad , and our external act -- although it 's crude and untied , a big impact on our lives .
being fearless is for me to be honest today .
and i stand on this stage because i 'm a model .
i stand on this stage because i 'm a lovely , white woman , and in my business , we call this a sexy girl .
i 'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but in the honest way .
the first question is , " how will you want a model ? "
i always say , " oh , i was discovered , " but that doesn 't mean anything .
the real reason i became a model is a win in the genetic lottery and an important legacy and maybe ask yourself , what that heritage is made of .
well , in the last few centuries , we have not only defined beauty as healthy and jung , which we 've programmed biologically , but also as big , slim and bright and bright .
this legacy was created for me . and it 's a legacy that 's out for me .
i know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point , and maybe some fashion designers might call out , " stop . naomi , tyler . yo .
and first , i gather their model knowledge . very impressive .
but unfortunately , i 've got to tell you that in 200 ⁇  , a very ambitious graduate student , all the models were counted on the runway , every single one that 's been practiced , and that from 6 ⁇  ⁇  , only 2 ⁇  or less than four percent had no white .
the next question i 'm always asked is , " can i will be a model when i grow up ? "
and first i say , " i don 't know that 's not in my responsibility . "
but the second answer i really want to give this little girl is , " why ?
you know what ? you can become everything .
you can be president of the u.s. or the inventor of the next internet or a ninja master surgeon , which would be completely insane , because then you were the first one . "
if you still say , " no , no , cameron , i want to be a model , " i 'll say , " my boss . "
because i don 't have a responsibility for anything , and you could be the editorial director of american bird , or the ceo of h  ⁇  m or the next to steven me .
to say that you want to be a model later , is like saying that once you want to win the jackotlot on the lottery .
you can 't manipulate it , and it 's fantastic , and it 's not a career path .
now , i want to demonstrate you 10 years of a model model of knowledge , because unlike a heart surgeons , it can only only have to have to have a construction right now .
it looks something like this .
hopefully less strange than that in the middle .
this was ... i don 't know what happened .
if you finished school and you 've done a resume and you 've done a few jobs , unfortunately you can 't say much anymore . if you say you want to be president of the u.s. , but in r ⁇  , " 10 years old , " you 're going to look at it .
the next question i 'm often asked is , " are all of the photos be reflected ? "
and yes , quite so all of the photographs are being rejected , but that 's just a small part of what happened .
this is the very first picture i made , and that was the very first time i had a bikini , and i didn 't even have my period .
i know this is going to be pretty personally , but i was a young girl .
this is what i looked like a few months earlier , with my grandmother .
that 's me the day of the supermarket shoot .
my friend had to have to accompany me .
this is me on a slumber party , a few days before a supermarket shoot for the french bird .
this is me with the football team and v- v- magazine .
and that 's me today .
and i hope you can see these pictures are not pictures of me .
it 's constructed , and it 's constructed by a group of professionals , by haifers and makeup and makeupers and photographers and all of their assistants and their post-profit and production . they 're not me .
okay , the next thing people always ask me , " are you get stuff for nothing ? "
yes , i 've got too many of these 30-inch shoes i can never wear , but the things i get for free are things that i get in real life and talk about it .
i grew up in cambridge , and one day i went to a shop , and i had forgotten my money , and you gave me the dress for free .
when i was a teenager , i was driving to my friend , a terrible driver , and she went through a red traffic light , and of course we stopped . it took one : " sorry , mr. doctor , " and we could go on .
i got these free things because of my look and not because of my personality , and there are people who look like their appearance and don 't pay for their personality .
i live in new york , and i live by the 140 teenagers who have been stopped last year , and they were covered , 85 percent of black and latinos and mostly young men .
it lives in new york just 1 ⁇ ,000 young , male and latino boys , for which don 't ask the question , " am i going to stopped ? "
they said , " how often am i get stopped ? when am i stopped ? "
in my research for this talk , i found that 53 percent of every 13-year-old girls in the united states don 't like their body , and that number goes up to  ⁇ 8 percent when they 've become 1 ⁇  .
the last question to me is , " what is it to be a model ? "
and i think they expect that answer , " if you 're a little thinner and shine hair , you feel very happy and fabulous . "
and back-based , we give an answer that might give this impression .
we say , " it 's really great to travel so much , and it 's great to work with creative , inspired to work with passionate people . "
all of that is true , but it 's only half of the story , because what we never ever say before the camera i never said before the camera is , " i feel unsure . "
and i feel unsure because i have to think about my look every day .
and if you ever wondered , " would i would be happier if i had thin legs and shine ? "
and then you should meet some models , because they have the thin legs and the shiny hair and the coolest clothes , and they 're the ones because of their appearance probably are the most insecure women on the planet .
when i prepared this talk , it seemed very difficult to pull an honest balance , because one thing i felt very uncomfortable with me to sit down here and say , " i got all the benefits of a pile that got into my credit , " and it doesn 't feel very good enough to do that . "
it was especially difficult , a legacy of oppression , because of gender and race , when i 'm one of the greatest benefit from the greatest benefit .
if you take something out of this talk , hopefully that we all recognize the power of the image in our perceived successes and failures .
thank you . thank you .
i never forgot the words of my grandmother who 's come to life in exile : " son , le baraer resistance . fight him .
but never will never become something like a monda revolution . "
it 's been nearly two years since the libyan revolution has been inspired by the waves of mass graves in the tunisian and the egyptian revolution .
i 'm allies with a lot of other foreign fighters and outside of foreign fighters to launch a day of anger and launch a revolution against the tyrannosaur regime .
and there she was , a big revolution .
boy , libyan women and men were standing in the first row , the end of the regime , slash was the freedom , and social justice into the air .
they 've proved an example of courage by putting themselves against the brutal ancient dictatorship ,
they have shown a strong sense of solidarity , from the far east over the far west , to the south .
finally , after six months of violent war and almost 50,000 dead , we managed to free our country and drop the tyrants .
but for gaddafi , though , there 's a huge burden on legacy , a legacy of the tyranny , corruption , and the basis for course .
over four decades , ginihtian regimes , both the infrastructure , and culture and moral structure of moral society .
the devastation and the challenges , i burned , as many other women to rebuild the civil society of libya , and we asked a bright and just transition to democracy and national scale .
virtually 200 organizations were formed during and immediately after the case of gaddafi in bengisu chen , almost 300 in trichisaris .
after 33 years in exile , i came back to libya , and with unique enthusiasm , i started organizing workshops to the issues of human development and leadership development .
with a wonderful group of women , i founded the peace talks of women , a movement of women , leaders from different spheres of life , whose goal is to stand to stand in public empowerment of women and for our right to equal rights activists for democracy and private peace .
in the front of the elections , i met on a very difficult environment , a environment that 's always more and more polarized . a environment that was defined by the selfish politics of dominance and exclusion .
i led an initiative to the peace laureateque storytelling , to achieve a vote law act , a law that every citizen , no matter what kind of background , which should be right to vote and run , and especially for political parties for political parties to compromise on a different political side , and on a lot of different standards .
at the end , our initiative was taken over and succeeded .
women won 1 ⁇ .5 percent of the national congress in the first election for 52 years .
but slowly , surely the e.u.u.a. election , and all the revolution -- because every day we wake up with new news of violence .
one morning , we went to report on decimaging great-time guards and sufi shirt .
on another morning , we received news about the murder of american ambassador and attack on the message .
again , another morning , the signature file of the army officers 's army .
and really every day , we awakening under the regime of the militia , and their continued against humanity 's rights and their cause of rules and laws .
our society , shaped by a revolution in mind , polarizedized and taken away from the ideal and principles , " freedom , social justice  ⁇  that she had initially at first .
intact , intolerance , revenge and revenge became the icons of the revolution .
i 'm not there today to inspire you with the success story of our fangs and the elections .
rather , i 'm here today to confess that as a nation that made false choice and the wrong decisions .
we set our priorities wrong .
because elections didn 't bring peace nor stability or security or security in libya .
did the high-and-one list , and the shift between female and male candidate peace and national reconciliation ?
no , it didn 't .
what is it then ?
why is our society continues to continue and dominated by selfish politics of the dominance and the conflict , both from men and women ?
maybe the women were not the only thing that was missing , but the female values of compassion , the grace and the conflict .
our society needs a national dialogue and consensus that it took the elections , which at the end has only encourages the polarization and rehab .
our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female more than it needs the numerical , quantitative embodiment of the female .
we need to stop acting in the name of anger and ask a day of revenge .
we need to start in the name of compassion and mercy .
we need to develop a female discourse that doesn 't just add value , but also to promote instead of revenge , instead of competition , instead of competition , a deceptive instead of exclusion .
these are the ideals that takes a war is desperate to achieve peace .
because peace has a chemistry , and in this al chemistry , it 's all about the feminineness of the feminine and massage .
that 's the real estate 250,000 .
and that 's what we need to do existential action before we do it sociopolitical acts .
after a verse from the quran " salam " -- peace  ⁇  " is the word of the good god , rah . "
the word " rah " again , which is known in all abraham traditions , has the same arabic root as the word " rah "  ⁇  mother  ⁇  and that symbolizes the mothers that surround the whole humanity from which the male and the female , and all of the tribes , and all the tribes and the tribes .
and just like the mother the embryo that grows in it , fully surrounds the basic framework of compassion feeds the entire existence of compassion .
and so we said , " my grace deserved all things . "
and so we were told us , " my grace has stuck in front of my g minor . "
may all of us will be provided the mercy of grace .
thank you .
when i was little , i thought my country was the best in the world , and i grew up with the song " nothing to envy . "
and i was very proud .
in school , we 're going to tell the story of kim jong-s , but we didn 't get much about the world out there , except that america , south korea and japan are our enemies .
although i often wondered how the outside the outside world , i thought i would spend my whole life in north korea up to a whole change in time .
at seven years old , i saw an open direction , but i thought my life was normal in north korea was normal .
my family was not poor , and i had never had to suffer hunger .
but in 1995 , my mother took a letter with the sister from a colleague of a colleague .
and it said , " if you read this , our five family members will not be in this world , because we 've had nothing since two weeks .
we lie down on the ground and our bodies are so weak that we 're dying . "
i was so shocked .
i first heard that people were suffering in my country .
shortly after that , i went down at the station , and i saw something horrible that i can 't delete anymore from my memory .
a legged woman was lying on the floor , and a child-eyed child in her arm looked helpless in the face of his mother .
but nobody helped them because everybody was so busy to care about themselves and their families .
in the mid-1990s , there was a great famine in north korea .
at the end , more than a million north koreans of famine victims , and many more survive , because they ate the grass , dung beetles and trees .
blackouts are getting more and more common , so that at night around me , except the lights of china on the other side of the shore , where we lived .
i always wondered why they had lights there and we didn 't .
this is a satellite image of north korea and his neighbors at night .
this is the river on therok , which is part of this is a border between north korea and china .
as you can see , the flow can be very shallow and allows north koreans can escape the escape .
but many die .
sometimes i saw the bodies drive across the river .
i can 't tell a lot about how i left north korea , but i can say that during the devastating years of famine , i was sent to china to china .
i just thought that i would be separated for a short period of my family .
i 'd never thought it would take 14 years to bring it back together .
in china , it was very hard to live without a young girl without family .
i didn 't have an idea of how life would be north koreans , but soon i learned that it 's not just extremely difficult , but it 's also very dangerous , because north koreans are seen in china as illegal immigrants .
so i lived in constant fear that my true identity could fly up , and you 'd send me back to north korea .
one day my biggest nightmare was true when i was caught by the chinese police police station , and put it into the police station .
somebody was accused me to be north koreans , so they tested my chinese skills and asked me countless questions .
i was scared , i thought my heart would explode .
if anything unnatural would appear to be locked up and be denied .
i thought that would be the end of my life , but i managed to control my feelings and answered the questions .
and after they finished the questions , one official task to another , " that was a false came out .
it 's not a north koreans . "
and they let me go . it was a miracle .
some north koreans , he challenges in foreign messages in foreign messages , but many will get caught by the chinese police police and they 'll notice .
these girls were very lucky .
although they were caught , after all , it was released because of huge international pressure .
these north koreans were not so much happiness .
every year , countless north koreans are caught up in china and gathering to north korea , where they tortured , jail or publicly available .
although i was lucky enough , many other north koreans don 't go like that .
it 's tragic that north koreans need to hide their identity and hard to survive .
even after they 've learned a new language and work , their world can be posted at a moment .
so after 10 years of hiding , i decided to go to south korea , and again , i started a new life .
in south asia , i was a greater challenge than i thought it was .
in south korea was so important that i had to start learning my third language .
and i also noticed the great difference between north and south korea .
we 're all the koreans , but inside we 've been very apart because of a 6 ⁇  years of division .
i went through an identity crisis .
am i 'm south or north koreans ?
where am i come from ? who am i ?
suddenly there was no country that my home could have been .
although i didn 't light my life didn 't light me , i had a plan .
i prepared myself for the recording research at the university .
just when i turned to my new life , i got a shock call .
the north koreans started sending the money that i sent my family , and as a punishment became stable my family , in a remote place on the country .
they had to escape as quickly as possible , so i started to plan your flight .
north koreans , there 's a tremendous amount of their way to the freedom .
it 's almost impossible to cross the border between north and south korea , and ironically , i took a flight back to china and made me to the north koreans border .
because my family didn 't have a chinese language , i had to lead them on more than 2,000 miles across china and then to southeast asia .
the bus ride took a week , and we were nearly many times .
once the bus was shut in , a chinese police officer came in .
he took the evidence of everybody and started asking questions .
because my family had no chinese mind , i thought they 'd be arrested .
when the chinese officials turned my family , i was determined and i told him that they were tau , and i was her a stand .
he looked at me suspicious , but fortunately he believed me .
we did it up to lao border , but i had to use almost all of my money to bribe the border lanes of laos .
but even after we crossed the border , my family was incarcerated because of illegal cross borders .
after spending money sentence and bribe , my family was released within a month , but soon my family was incarcerated , my family was sent back in the capital of laos .
this was one of the biggest setbacks of my life .
i had done everything to help my family 's freedom , and we were so close , but my family was arrested , just before the south florida message .
i went back and forth between immigration department and the police department , trying to free my family , but i didn 't have enough money to pay back and pay money .
i lost all my hope .
and i asked the voice of a man , " what 's going on ? "
and i was completely surprised that a stranger cares about this .
in broken english , and with a dictionary , i explained my situation and no hesitation , he went to a bench , and paid the money for my family and two more north koreans to get them out of jail .
i thanked him from all my heart and i said , " why do you help me ? "
" i don 't help them , " he answered .
" i 'll help the north koreans in north koreans . "
i realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life .
this previously , strangers intervened for me to create a new hope that the north koreans need so badly , and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community as the hope that the north koreans need .
finally , after our long journey , my family and i was reunited in south korea , but the freedom to reach is just one step .
many north koreans are separated from their families , and once they arrive in a new country , they start with little or even any money .
the international community can help us with education , the english , the vocational training and so many more .
we can also be the bridge between the people in north korea and the outside , because many of us remain in contact with families , and we send them information and money that helps to change north korea from within .
i was so lucky enough to get so much help and inspiration in my life , that i want to make hope for success , with international support .
i 'm sure you 're going to see a lot more successful north koreans all over the world , also on the stage of ted .
thank you .
i only have one please today .
please don 't tell me that i 'm normal .
i 'm going to introduce you now my brothers .
remi is 22 , big and very handsome .
he can 't speak , but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best speakers couldn 't speak .
remi white knows what love is .
he shares it unconditional , and he divides them .
he 's not greedy . he doesn 't look at the skin color .
he doesn 't care about religious differences and imagine himself : he never told a lie .
when he 's singing songs from our childhood , words tries to try and not even remember , he reminds me of one thing : how little we know about the mind and how wonderful that must be unknown .
samuel is 16 . he 's big . he 's very handsome .
he 's got an absolutely unmus memory .
but it also has a selectively .
he can 't remember whether he stole my chocolate brownish , but he remembers that the publication of every song on my ipod , talking about when he was four , during the very first episode of the telecommunications amongst my arm and a lady .
don 't you listen to yourself incredibly ?
but many people don 't agree .
and in fact , because your mind doesn 't fit into the social version of normal , they often get over and wrong .
but what changed my heart and my soul has empowered , was that although this was the case , although they were not normal , this could only mean that they were extraordinarily -- autistic and extraordinary .
now , for those of you who are not so familiar with the term " autism , " it 's a complex function of the brain that influences social communications , learning and sometimes physical skills .
it 's different from each individual different , so remi is so unlike sam .
and in the world , every 20 minutes in a new person in autism and even though there 's one of the fastest growing developmental disorders in the world , there 's no known cause or cure .
and i can 't remember the first time i encounter autism , but i can 't remember one day without it .
i was only three years old when my brother was born , and i was so excited that i had a new creature in my life .
and after a few months , i realized he was different .
he yelled a lot .
he didn 't want to play how the other babies did , and in fact , he didn 't seem very interested in being at all .
remi lived and re-interest in his own world , with his own rules , and he found joy about the smallest things , like cars in a row in the room to crack the washing machine and eat anything that came under him .
and as he got older , it was different and the differences became more visible .
but behind the anger and the frustrated and the never end of the hyperactivity was something really unique : a pure and innocent nature , a boy who saw the world without prejudice , a human who never had never been lied .
extraordinary .
now , i can 't deny that there were a few challenging moments in my family , moments where i wish i wish they were just like me .
but i go back to the thoughts that they 've taught me about individuality , communication and love , and i understand that these are things that i wouldn 't want to exchange for normal .
normality , the beauty that are giving us , and the fact that we 're different , doesn 't mean that one of us is wrong .
it just means there 's a different kind of right way .
and if i could just say one thing to say and sam and to them , it would be that you don 't have to be normal .
you may be extraordinary .
because autistic or not , the differences we have -- we have a gift -- each of us has a gift in itself , and in all honesty , the pursuit of normal is the ultimate sacrifice of potential .
the opportunity size , progress and change will die in the moment where we 're trying to be like someone else .
please -- please don 't tell me i 'm normal .
thank you . thank you .
and edgressed has accomplished us with awe and curiosity , with this photograph on the one , an apple ran an apple , and with a memory date from just one millionth .
but now , 50 years later , we 're a million times faster and see the world not with a million or a billion , but a trillion frames a second .
i 'm going to show you a new kind of photography , which is the fickness , which is so fast that it can create time- footage of light into motion .
and with that , we can build cameras that look outside our view , or without an x-ray photograph in our bodies and really question what we mean with " camera . "
now , if i take a laser pointer , and i turn it in a trillion second and out -- these are several second -- i create a package of photons that 's hardly a millimeter wide , and this photons , which is project that project is going to start moving around , and when i go on a light .
so if you take this project , this photons , and shoot it into this bottle , how are these photons going to break in the bottle ?
what does light-size light in slow motion ?
so , this whole event --
so , remember , this whole event actually takes less than a nanosecond -- that 's how long it takes light to go back this track -- but i slowed down this video to 10 billion so you can see the light into motion .
no , coca-cola didn 't fund this research .
so , in this film , a lot happens very much , so let me analyze the analyze and show you what happens .
the pulse , our project , goes into the bottle with an photons , starting to move through and breaks down inside .
part of the light goes out to the table , and you see this spread of waves .
many of the photons eventually achieve the shutter of the bottle and explode in different directions .
as you can see , there 's a bubble bubble that breaks around in the bottle .
meanwhile , the waves are spreading on the table and because of the reflex of the top of the top of the reflex at the end of the bottle are focused on some images .
now , if you take a very common project that 's going to have the same track and let the video back around 10 billion , you know how long you have to sit here to see the movie ?
one day , a week ? no , a year .
this would be a very boring movie -- -- -- from a slow , normal , normal-size-scale movement .
and what about something still-life photograph ?
you can see again , this waves are the table , the tomates and the wall in the background .
it 's like throwing a stone into a pond .
it seemed to me as if nature would paint a picture , each of a femt image , but of course our eye looks at an act of an act .
but if you look at this tomography , you 'll see that if the light turns on the tomates , it will keep on . it 's not dark .
why is that ? because the tom 's ripe and the light goes around it and comes back after a few trillion seconds .
so , in the future , if this nasty camera is built in your camera , it could be possible that you can go to a supermarket and find if a fruit flies without even touching it .
so how did my team built this camera ?
so , as photographers , you know , if you take a photo with a short time period , they have very little light , but we were belariously a billion times faster than their shortesttime high , so they don 't get any light .
so here 's what we 're doing : we 're sending this project , this photons , that photons , million times , and then we record this again and again with very clever synchronize , and we combine this gigawatts of data , we 're able to create these bellies that i showed you .
and we can take all these raw data and make very interesting things .
so , superman can fly .
other heroes can make themselves invisible , but how about a new super force for a future superheroes : to see corners ?
the idea is that we put some light on the door .
it 's going to break down into the room , part of it 's going to bounce back to the door , and eventually we could use that more times the weight of light .
and this is not science fiction . we 've actually built it already .
on the left you see our fem-to-to-to-to- camera .
behind the wall is a wall is hidden , and we 'll let the lights off on the door .
after we published in the nature of nature 's paper was published by nature , and they created this animation .
and because we have a camera that 's so fast -- our femt camera has some unique skills .
she 's done a very good time , and she can look at the world at the speed of light .
and by doing that , of course , we know the distance to the door , but also the hidden objects , but we don 't know which point to which distance .
by making a laser light , we can record a raw photograph , which -- as you can see on the screen -- not really makes sense , but then when we absorb many of these images , dozens of these images , and they 're trying to analyze the different light , we can see the object .
can we see it in 3d ?
so this is our reconstruction .
we still have a lot to do before we could implement the lab into practice , we could build cars that avoid collisions , and see what 's behind the curve , or we can go into dangerous ones , looking for light by looking at light that we can see light , or we can point to see dark energy .
but because of the blood vessel and tissue , of course , this is very challenging , which is why this really is a wake-up call for scientists , now thinking about double- photography , because there 's a new picture of the next generation of medical problems .
but it 's also happens funny .
if you look at these waves under the bottles of the bottles , you can see that the waves of us move away .
the waves should be moving towards us .
what happens here ?
it turns out that we 've taken almost at the speed of light , have weird effects , and einstein would have seen this picture incredibly loved .
the order , in the events in the world , it appear in the camera lens in reverse order , so , by applying the corresponding relationship of space and time , we can update this bias .
it 's time . thank you . thank you .
there are many ways that our fellow human beings can improve our lives .
we don 't meet any neighbors on the street , so that a lot of wisdom don 't be passed on , but we use the same public public spaces .
over the last few years , i 've been trying to share more with my neighbors and using things like stickers , stencils and chalk .
and the projects came out of my questions , how much rent pay my neighbors pay my neighbors ?
how can we lend more things without disturbing each other ?
how can we share our memories of the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better ?
and how can we share our hopes for vacant homes so that our communities reflect our needs and dreams ?
i live in new orleans and i love new orleans .
my soul is going to calm down by the great estuary , who have been in love for hundreds of years , drunk , drunk and dreamscape . i trust a city where there 's always music .
i think every time somebody ever , there 's a poster in new orleans .
in this city , some of the most beautiful buildings in the world , but it 's also the city with most abandoned land in america .
i live near this house and i was thinking about how i can preserve it , and i also thought about something that changed my life forever .
in 2009 , i lost someone i loved .
her name was joan , and she was like a mother for me , and her death came suddenly and unexpected .
i 've been thinking a lot about death , and i felt a great gratitude for my life , and it taught me about the things that are important to me in life .
but i 'm hard to keep this view every day to stay alive .
it 's easy to lose themselves in your day and forgetting what 's really important .
with the help of old and new friends , i turned out a side of the house into a giant blackboard , and i wrote a barrier to the gaps : " before i die , i want to ... " everybody who comes along , a piece of chalk , can take his life on his life and his life .
i wasn 't sure what i could expect in the experiment , but the next day , the wall was completely crowded , and it continued to grow .
i want to share some sentences with you that were written by the people on the wall .
" before i die , i want to be prosecuted for piracy . "
" before i die , i want to be a broadly about the international telecommunications line . "
" before i die , i want to sing for millions of people . "
" before i die , i want to plant a tree plants . "
" before i die , i 'd like to live " web bias . "
" before i die , i 'd like to hold you again in my poor . "
" before i die , i 'd like to be somebody 's cavalry . "
" before i die , i want to be myself . "
this neglected place has become a meaningful place , and the hopes and dreams of people brought me laugh , to cry and tear me during the hard times .
it 's about knowing that you 're not alone .
it 's about understanding our neighbors in a new and illuminating way .
it 's about building space and to think and remember what is most important to us as we grow and change .
i did this last year , and i received hundreds of news from passionate people who wanted to build a wall with their community , so my colleagues and i built a construction kit , and now have been built around the world in kazakhstan , australia , australia , argentina and other walls .
we 've shown how much power have our public places , if we have the opportunity to speak up and share more with others .
two of the most valuable things we have is time and relationships with other people .
in a world with increasing distractions , it 's more important than ever before to look at things with the right look and think that life is short and sensitive .
we 're often accused of talking about death , or even thinking about it , but i realized that the preparation is to be one of the things that most of us most .
and the idea of death is how we live life .
our shared spaces are best to show us as individuals and as a community , and with more opportunities to share our hopes and stories , the people around us can 't just help us create better places , they can help us live better .
thank you . thank you .
thank you . thank you .
so , i 'm involved in applied mathematics . a particular problem for anyone who 's dealing with applied mathematics is that we are like business consultant .
nobody knows what we actually do .
so today i 'm going to try to try to explain to you what i do .
dance is one of the most human activity .
we 're delighted with sight of master ballet and steady , as you 'll see in a minute .
for the ballet is an extraordinary amount of knows about knowledge and skills , and possibly a basic ingredients that could have a genetic component .
sadly , kills neurological disorders like parkinson 's slowly this extraordinary ability , and that 's what she does to do in my well-known , who was at his time a ballet-viralation .
over the years , you 've done a lot of progress in treatment .
yet , there are 6.3 million people worldwide who suffer from this disease , and you have to deal with the debilitating symptoms like weakness , fear , stiffness and others that causes this disease , so we need objective means to discover the disease before it is too late .
we need to measure progress , and ultimately , the only way to really know if there is healing , if we have an objective , that can answer that question .
it 's alarming that for parkinson 's disease and other movements don 't have a biomarkers , so you can 't do an easy blood analysis , and the best thing you have is this 20-minute walk test .
you have to do it in the clinic . it 's very expensive , and that means , outside clinical trials will never do that . never .
but what if patients could make this test home ?
that would spare a trip to the hospital . what if patients could do this test themselves ?
it wouldn 's not have to have an expensive healthcare workers .
by the way , it costs 300 percent to look at the neurological legal department .
so i 'd like to propose to you a unconventional way that we 're trying to do that , because we 're all , in a certain sense , at least , virtual ,
here you see a video of vibrating strings .
this is happening in healthy state , when someone comes up , and we can think of as a vocal ballet dancer , because we have to coordinate all of these organs , if we produce loud , and we all have the genes for it . foxp2 , for example .
and how ballet does it requires a lot of practice .
remember how long a child needs a child until it learns .
by loud , we can freak the position of vibrating noise , and as the limbs are also affected by parkinson 's organs .
on the lower level , you can see an example of irregular arrangements of noise .
we always see the same symptoms .
voiceororor , weakness , stiffness .
the language is actually gets even lower over time and stream and it 's an example of an example of an example of that .
these impacts on the voice can be minimal , sometimes , but with digital microphones and precision information analysis , combined with new machine learning , which is now very advanced , we can now figure out where someone is , within a disease between disease and health , just because of that .
how can these tests can measure with clinical chart ? well , they 're both non-invasively . the test did when you did neurologists .
similarly , the infrastructure is already there .
you don 've got to build new clinics for this .
and they 're exactly . and they 're not being done by experts .
so you can be conducted on its own .
they 're very fast , take 30 seconds or 30 seconds .
they 's very cheap , and we know what that means .
if something 's extremely cheap , you can also use it in large extent .
and this amazing goals we can now achieve with this .
we can reduce the patient problem for patients .
patients don 't have to deliver routine training in the clinic in the clinic .
we can gain objective data through so that we can gain health data from a frequent observation .
we can do use low-scale mass amateur clinical trials for clinical trials , and let the first study the whole population can be done .
we now have the opportunity to look for the first for the disease , before it 's too late .
today we 're going to take the first step in this direction , we start the parkinson 's voice program .
with an alleg and patient treatments , we want to take a very high number of voices worldwide to own enough data for achieving these goals .
we have reputation numbers that are worth one billion people on this planet .
anyone , with or without parkinson 's , can phone calls for a few cents for a few cents , and i 'm familiar with delight that we 've already reached six percent of our goal in just eight hours .
thank you . thank you .
if you take samples of , say 10,000 people , then you can tell who is healthy and who isn 't ?
what will you do with all these specimens ?
what happens is that the patient 's got to boast about whether this person has to suffer or not . ok .
some of you may not be able to end .
but we collect a huge database , under different circumstances , which is interesting . these conditions are important , because we 're involved in order to see which are the actual markers of parkinson 's .
right now , your 86 percent accuracy has its 86 percent accuracy ?
it 's much better .
my student 's head -- i have to praise him because he 's done so fantastic work -- now shows that it also works on cell phones , which allows this project , and we 're 99 percent accuracy .
that 's what i call an improvement .
that means people can -- people can call with the mobile phone and do the test . people with parkinson 's disease could pick their voice , so that your physician can check the progress of the disease .
exactly .
thank you . max suffered , ladies and gentlemen  ⁇ 
thank you , tom .
here i live . i live in kenya at the edge of the nairobi , national park .
in the background , you see my father 's cows , and the behind the cows is the nairobi park .
the nairobi park is just in the south places that mean that wildlife can only travel out of the park .
the predators , the lions , follow them . and then they do this .
they kill our livestock .
this is one of our cows that was killed at night , and i woke up in the morning , and it was dead . it was our only cop .
my tribe , the maas 's tribe , believes that we came together with our animals and the white cane is from heaven , and that 's why our animals mean so much .
as a child , i learned to hate lions .
our warrior hot morans . they protect our tribe and our herds , and they 're also upset about this problem .
and killing the lion .
here 's one of six lions killed in nairobi .
and i think there 's only so few lions in the nairobi national park .
in my tribe , a boy between six and nine years , the cows is responsible for his father 's cows . so i did .
i had to find a solution .
my first idea was fire . lions are afraid of fire .
but then i realized that this wouldn 't really would help us , but help the lion to see the cows better .
but i didn 't give up . i continued .
i had a second idea . i tried it with a bird flu .
i wanted the lions thought i would run out next to the cow shed .
but lions are very smart animals .
you come , look at bird flu and go again . next time , but come and say , this thing doesn 't mean , that 's still there .
and they reach and they kill our livestock .
one night , i would fill the barn . i ran with a torch in the hand around him and this time the lions don 't bother .
lion is afraid of light that moves .
i had an idea .
as a little boy , i was working throughout my room all day , and even the new radio my mother 's radio , and that day it almost took me around , but i had learned a lot about electronics .
i took an old car battery pack , and i pulled a motorcycle crashes out of a motorcycle . it shows if you want to turn right or left . it 's blinking .
and i got a switch to get the lights and disgrazing .
this is a little pear from a broken flashlight .
and then i built everything together .
the solar panel the battery , the battery puts electricity on the surface , and i call it a transformer .
and the motorola thrash .
you can see that the birkends right out , because from where the lions come from .
and this is what it looks like for lions , when they come .
the lights and the lions believe that i go around the barn , and i was in bed all the time .
thank you . thank you .
i installed this at home with us , and since then we had no problems with lions .
and then our neighbors heard about it .
one of them was this grandmother .
she had lost a lot of their animals , and she asked me if i could install her the lights .
and i said , " yes . "
i installed the lights . you can see the lions in the background .
since then , i 've got seven houses in the neighborhood with the lights , and they 've worked really well .
my idea is now used in all of kenya , including other predators like hyenas or leopards , and the lights also serve to keep the elephants from farms .
my invention placed a scholarship to me on one of the best schools in kenya , brook international school , and i 'm really excited .
my new school was committed , and helping fundraising and education and enlightenment .
i even brought my friends home with me , and we install the lights where there 's no yet , and i 'm showing people how to use it .
a year ago , i was just a boy from the savanna , who had his father was throwing her , and i saw airplanes about me and i said , " one day i 'm going to sit in one  ⁇  "
and here i am here .
i was allowed to use an airplane , for my first tedtalk .
if i 'm big , i want to become an airplane engineer and a pilot . that 's my big dream .
i used to hated lions . but through my invention , i can save the cows of my father 's cows , and the lions . we can share , page , with the lions , with the lions , without arguing .
ashburn . in my language , that means thank you very much .
you don 't know how exciting it is to hear a story like your listening .
so you have this scholarship . yes .
you work on other electrical innovations .
what 's the next on the list ?
my next invention , well , i work on an electric fence . an electric fence ?
yeah , i know , electrical fences are long ago , but i want my own .
you 've tried it again , right -- yeah , i 've tried it before , but i tried it again , because i got -- a blow .
it 's hard . richard turin , you 're something very special .
we 're going to counter you every step of your journey , my friend .
thank you . thank you . thank you .
since i was old enough to keep a camera in my hand , photography is my passion , but today i want to share with you 15 of my favorite pictures , and not one of them i did .
there was no kind of directors , no such lists , no way to shoot an image . not even the lighting was accepted .
to be honest , most of them happened by random tourist .
my story begins when i was a talk in new york , and my wife made this picture on which i hold my daughter on her first birthday on my arm . we were on the corner of 5 ⁇  5 ⁇  5 and 5 .
a year later , we were back in new york , and so we decided to shoot the same picture again .
well , you can see where this goes ...
when my third birthday came to my daughter , my wife said , " hey , why don 't you try to do it to new york , and it 's a father traveled to lead the ritual ? "
at the time , we started asking ourselves to make a picture of us .
you know , it 's remarkable how universal the gesture is if you 're enough your camera is enough .
no one has ever said no , and fortunately , no one 's ever managed to dance with our camera .
at the time , we didn 't know how much these journeys would change our lives .
this journey has become very sacred .
this was taken only weeks after 9  ⁇  11th , and i had to explain what happened on the day so that a five-year-old can understand it .
these pictures are much more than just a single moment , or a particular journey .
they are also an opportunity for a week in october , to stop and change time and how we change year from year , not just physically but in everything .
because although we always do the same picture , our perspective changes from times , as you always reach new milestones , i can see life with your eyes , as they do with everything , and as it sees it .
this very intense time we spend with each other is something that we value and expect every year .
the other day , as one of our trips , we went for a walk , and suddenly , it reveals it on a red flag of a doll dish that they learned as a little kid at the previous traveling .
and she told me about her feelings she had as a five-year-old , at the same time .
she said she 's reminiscent of how her heart jumped out of the chest , when she first saw the store the store for the first time .
and now she looks up in new york to high schools , because she really wants to study it in new york .
and i realized , the most important thing we all create are memories .
and so i 'd like to share with you the idea of taking an active role in the conscious building memories of memories .
i don 't know what it looks like in you , but apart from those 15 images , i 'm on hardly any family photo .
i 'm always who makes the picture .
i 'd like to encourage you to come with you today , and don 't ask someone asking you , " would you make a picture of us ? "
thank you .
