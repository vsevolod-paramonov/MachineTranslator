when i was 11 years old , i was one morning from the sad joy .
my father listened to his little , gray radio show the news of the bbc .
he looked very happy from what was pretty unusual , because it was the news .
he called , " the taliban are gone  ⁇  "
i didn 't know what that meant , but it made my father obviously very , very happy .
" now you can go to a right school , " he said .
this morning i 'll never forget .
one .
the taliban made the power in afghanistan when i was six , and banned girls to school .
that 's why i kept thinking about five years as young and my older sister who didn 't have to go back to a secret school .
just as we could go to school .
every day , we took another way so that no one could be depending where we went .
we signal our books in shopping bags so it looked as if we 're going .
teach us in a house , over 100 girls in a small living room .
in the winter , but it was incredibly hot .
we all knew that we had our lives of life : teachers and our parents .
and again , the class suddenly , suddenly , a week , because the taliban had been .
we were never sure how much they knew about us .
do you ?
did you know where we ?
we were scared , but we wanted to go to school .
i had been lucky in a family of family , in education as important and daughters .
my grandfather was his time .
a outsider from a remote province of afghanistan , and he insisted his daughter -- my mother -- my mother -- to go to school , and was rejected by his father .
my high school , teacher became teacher .
that is .
two years ago she went to the retirement , just to turn our house in a school for girls and women from the neighborhood .
and my dad -- to see here -- the first one in his family who ever received a education .
it was always clear that his children would receive education , even his daughters , despite the taliban , despite all the risks .
he saw it as much bigger risk to send his kids to school .
i still know that in the years , sometimes frustrated as frustrated by our lives , from the fear of fear and fear .
that i had good lust , ran , but my father said , " daughter , listen to me . you can lose everything .
your money can be stolen . you can be in the war from your house .
but one thing will always stay : what 's in here , and even if we have to pay with our blood for your school fees , we will do that .
so -- do you still trying ? "
i 'm 22 years old .
i grew up in a country that 's grown through decades of war .
less than six percent of the women of my age have a higher degree than the axis , and when my family didn 't have been used to my education , i would have one of these women .
instead , i 'm standing here today , as a proud of the middle eastern college .
when i went to afghanistan , my grandfather , who was rejected by his family , because he put it to school to school , one of the first who was given me .
he didn 't just talk to my college , but also that i was the first woman and i 'm who drive him with the car through kabul .
my family at me .
i have big dreams , but my family has even bigger dreams for me .
that 's why i 'm a global fund for 108 , a global campaign for the education of women .
that 's why i 've helped to do it , the first and perhaps the only boarding school for girls in afghanistan , a country where the school kid is still risky .
it 's wonderful to see how the students engage in my school with great ambition , all of you want to perceive opportunities .
and to see how their parents and fathers for them once , as well as my parents for me , despite all due diligence .
as ahmed ahmed . that 's not his real name , and i can 't show his face , but ahmed the father of my students of my students .
a month ago , his daughter , his daughter , and he went to the way to their village , and they are death through a bomb on a bomb just a few minutes .
when he went home , the phone rang and a voice , if he sent his daughter to school , they would try again .
and he said , " kills me now , if you were to , but i 'm not going to put the future of my daughter 's success , because of your age of your life and coherent ideas . "
what afghanistan , so i realized something that 's often overlooked in the west : behind most of us who have success , a father that recognizes the value of his daughter , and the point is that their success is success .
that shouldn 't mean that our mothers don 't matter in our success .
in fact , they 're often the ones who are and compelling for a very promising future of their daughters . but in a society like afghanistan is the support of men .
in the taliban , only few hundred girls to school -- because it was illegal .
but today , in afghanistan today , in afghanistan over three million girls who regularly bank .
afghanistan is , from america , so different .
the americans see how they are changes are .
i 'm afraid that the changes are not long and they 're concerned with the u.s.s.s.s.s .
but when i 'm in afghanistan , when i look at the students in my school , and their parents that they 're going to encourage you , i see a most promising future and a long change .
afghanistan is for me , a country of hope and the boundless opportunities , and remind me every day the girls who visit the girls .
just like i have them big dreams .
thank you .
everything i do , also -- my life -- my life became seven years of work in africa as young man .
from 19 to 19 ⁇ 1 -- i see young , but it 's not -- i have in zambia , kenya , the ivory coast and somalia projects of projects with african countries .
i worked for a italian- italian , and every single project we put on the legs .
i was .
i , 21 years , i thought that we are good people and good work in africa .
instead , we kill everything we did .
our first project , what my first book , " what my first book is " inspired by the zaha . "
we came to italy with italy in southern sudan ; in this amazing valley , which leads to samara , and we gave the local population of the local italy and italy --
of course , the total certainly didn 't have any interest in this , so we 're working for the work , and sometimes they also sometimes .
we were amazed that there was no agricultural valley .
but instead of asking questions why they didn 't exist , we simply said , " thank god we are here  ⁇  "
" just in time to save people to save the people from the war . "
of course , all wonderful in africa .
we had these gorgeous tomato . in italy , they were so big , in zambia .
we couldn 't believe it , and we said , " looks like agriculture is . "
when the tomato and red , they were about 200 hertz about 200 hertz and the river and everything .
we said to the samboja lestari , " oh god , the nile , "
and they said , " yes , that 's why we don 't have agriculture here . "
" why don 't you say that ? " you never asked us . "
i just thought we were italians so great in africa , but then i saw what the americans did , what the french did , what the french did , after i saw what they did , i was pretty proud of our project .
we ended up at least the nile .
you should see the nonsense -- you should see the nonsense that we don 't have the deep african people .
you should read the book " list " from there , " by  ⁇  11 , she 's a sam economic growth .
the book was published .
we 've got the african continent has 1.5 trillion dollars in the last 50 years .
i 'm not going to tell you what this money has .
just read your book . read .
read from a africans , what we 've been doing .
we 're western people are imperialists , colonialists , mission , and there 's only two ways that we deal with people . we pat them or we are homo duplex .
both words comes from the latin root apex , " which means " dad means .
but they have two different .
patriarchy : i 'll wake up every other culture as if you were my children . " i love you so much . "
patisante : i 'm going every other culture , as if you were my servant .
that 's why white people are being in africa , called " bana , called " .
i became awake , when i read the book " small " cogito " by schi , and he said , especially in the economy , when people don 't want to help , let them stay in silence .
this should be the first principle of help .
the first principle of aid is respect .
and this morning , the gentleman who opened this conference , a pole on the ground , and said , " can you imagine a city that is not ? "
when i was 2 ⁇  years old , i decided to respond to people , and invented a system called intellectual , where never will never become somebody motivated , but you become a service of the local community of the local people who have a better person .
what you do -- you make your mouth .
you never reaches a community with ideas , you 're going with the local people together .
we don 't work from offices .
we meet in a cafe . we meet in pub .
we don 't infrastructure infrastructure . we don 't infrastructure .
we close and find out what the person wants .
the most important thing is the most important thing .
you can give someone idea .
if that person doesn 't like what should you do ?
the passion for your own growth is the most important thing .
the passion for its own growing is the most important of humanity .
we help you to know that , because nobody can be successful .
the person with the idea may not know , but it 's available .
many years ago , i had this line : why not in a community and say to people what to do , why don 't we hear them ? but not in community community .
let me give you a mystery .
there 's a problem with community organizer .
entrepreneurial never have part , and they will never say publicly , what you want to do with their money , what you see for opportunities .
planning has this blind spot .
people of the community , you don 't know , because they never meet too public .
we work one to one to do this , has to be created a social infrastructure that doesn 't exist .
a new job has to be created .
this is the house of the company , the house of the van , who 's sitting with them in your house , sitting in the cafe and in the cafe , helps them find the means to find their passion in a way to transform life .
i tried this in it , western australia , trying to try .
i went to the time , and i tried to get the hard core , where we tell others what they should do to escape .
i helped these five fishermen , working together , and these wonderful tuna , not selling a factory in albania for 60 cents , but after japan , for 15 dollars . then the farmers came to me and said , " hey , you can help us ? "
in a year i had 2 ⁇  projects . the government came to ask me , " how do you do this ?
how do you do ? " i said , " i do something very , very difficult .
i think the mouth and hear them . "
so -- -- so the government says , " do it again . "
we 've done it in 300 communities .
we 've done 40 companies in the financial firm .
there 's a new generation of companies that 's involved in loneliness .
peter printer , one of the best companies of history , died with 96 years ago .
peter printer was philosophy , before he started asking businesses , peter printer said , " planning is in reality with a entrepreneurial society and economics . "
planning is the death of the entrepreneur of the entrepreneur .
so , you build christine to know , without knowing what the smartest human being human race with their money and their energy .
you have to learn how to get these to come up to you .
you 've got to give you a lot of privacy and privacy . you have to be great it to help them , and they 're going to come out .
in a community of 10,000 people , we get 200 clients .
can you imagine a community of 400 people , the intelligence and passion ?
what do you have you most of the day today ?
local , passionate people . those have them .
i want to say that entrepreneurs is the right path .
we 're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- not innovative fossil fuels -- and suddenly there are systems that are not sustainable .
it 's not sustainable .
it 's not sustainable .
we need to look at how we feed seven billion people in sustainable ways , we can build and connect to them .
it 's not for it .
who 's going to invent this technology for the green revolution ? do you forget it  ⁇ 
the government ? forget ? forget it  ⁇ 
it will be entrepreneurs . and they 're going to do it now .
i read a beautiful story in a futuristic magazine ago .
there was a group of experts who were invited to meet the future of new york city year in the year of new york .
in 186 ⁇ 0 , they came together and put together , what happened in 100 years with the city of new york , and the conclusion was unity : the city would not exist in 100 years .
why ? they looked at the curve , and they said , if the population grows in this pace , they needed six million horses to get people , and it would be impossible to be done with the crap of six million .
because they went out of it .
1860 , you see the dirty technology that live life from new york .
what happens ? 40 years later , 1900 , in the united states -- 1001 .
the idea to find another technology , had done the race . there were tiny little factories in the process .
de janeiro , michigan . henry ford . henry ford .
there 's a mystery to work with entrepreneurs .
first of all , you 've got to you .
otherwise they don 't come and talk to you .
next thing you have to give you absolute , professional and passion .
then you have to tell you the absolute truth about entrepreneurs .
from the smallest to the biggest company all need to be able to be able to take three things : selling product needs to sell the grand product that needs to be grand and the financial book .
do you ?
we 've never met a single person who produce something , sell and sell to the money .
so there is not exists .
this person was never been born .
we 've done research , and we looked at the 100 companies of the world -- carnegie mellon , west , the new companies , google , google , yahoo .
there 's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world , just one : no one has been created by one person .
now , we teach 16-year-old year-old entrepreneurship , and we start teaching the lessons to give them the first two sides of richard branson , and the task of 16-year-old , it 's in the first two sides of richard serra , which is often used as often . "
never " i " and 32 times " we " . "
he was not alone when he started .
nobody started a company alone . no one . no one .
so we can create a community in which the facilitator who have a small background , in cafes and bars and bars -- their buddy , who are going to do for you , what somebody did for this gentleman who 's talking about this epic . somebody says , "
what can you ? can you make it ?
okay , can you sell it ? can you pay attention to the money ? "
" oh , no , i can 't . " " " do you want me for you ? "
it 's communities .
we have groups of volunteers who are supporting companies to help them find the resources and help people , and we found that the wonders of intelligence community , that the culture and the economy of this community can be changed by the passion and the economy of their imagination .
thank you . thank you .
five years ago , i 've learned how it must be , alice in the miracle .
the penn state university , i asked me -- a dodecahedron for communication -- for communication engineers in communication .
i was afraid of fear --
right fear . fear of these students with their big brains and their big books and their great love , not me words .
but when the conversation developed , it made me like alice when she can go down to the back and saw a door to a whole new world .
as i felt like i was talking to the students , and i was amazed about the thoughts that they had , and she wanted to realize that other miracle .
i think to open this door , need it great communication .
we need great communication of our scientists and engineers to change the world .
because our scientists and engineers are the ones who are our biggest problems , such as energy , environmental and health , and when we don 't know about it , and it 's not understanding , i think it 's not going to think of our responsibility as not that conversation .
but these great conversations don 't come from when our scientists and engineers don 't invite us in their wonder .
so scientists and engineers , please , please , we 're on us .
i want to show you a few approaches how you can do it , that we can see that science and technology that you 're dealing with you , sexy and exciting .
the first question you need to answer is : well , right ?
we 're saying why your scientific area is so relevant for us .
not only tells us that you 've been studying , but also tells us that their power plant , which is the mdgs in our bones , because it 's important to understand osteopor and treat osteop .
and if you describes what you do , then you 're academicians .
you 's an obstacle to understanding of your mind .
certainly , you could use it  ⁇  space and time , but why don 't you just say  ⁇  space and time , " what is much more interesting for us ?
our thought to make your mind is not the same as their level .
as einstein already said , " do things as easy as possible -- but not simpler . "
you can tell us something about your scientific area without having to have to change .
a few things are important : examples , examples , stories and analogies . in this way , you can pull us in your mind .
and if you put your work , then let 's go away .
have you ever wondered why it 's called " point ?
what happens when someone comes out ? another one else will only get out , and with those dots first person .
one slide like this is not just boring , but also to also talk too much on the language of our brain , and it 's how fast as we 're fast .
this example of genes of genes is much more powerful , and it shows that the special structure of the usage of the usage is so stable that it was even the inspiration for the eiffel tower .
the trick here is to use a single , simple sentence , just using the audience when it loses the thread , when it loses the thread , it 's using pictures and graphics that also creates our other senses and creates a deeper understanding of what you think .
these are just a few approaches that help us to open this door and see the miracle that the science and technology and technology in mountains .
because the engineers i 've been taught to me , with the " nerd glasses , i want to make everything with a equation .
so from your scientific papers and your heritage dictionary , they share this through the relevance , so the audience , which is important , and it 's all about passion that you have for your incredible work , and that 's a whole lot of new insights that are full of new insights .
so scientists and engineers , if you solved this equation , we 've been focused me .
thank you .
hi . that 's my phone .
a cell can change a life and a personal freedom .
with a mobile phone , you can film on the humanity in syria .
with a cell phone , you can get a message and a protestant in egypt .
and with a cell , you can take a song , it can be controlled and famous .
all that 's possible phone .
i 'm a year 1984 and live in berlin .
let 's go back in this city .
there you can see how hundreds of thousands of people went to the street and started .
we 're in the fall of 1989 , and imagine that all these people who were concerned about and changes , a cell phone in the pocket .
who in the room has a cell phone ?
hold it up .
hold your cell phone , hold up  ⁇ 
hold it up . a android , a blackberry , wow .
these are many . almost every one has a cell phone today .
but today i want to talk about me and my phone talk about how it changed my life .
and i 'll talk about this .
these are 3588 lines of information .
there .
and why are these information there ?
because in summer 2006 , the e.u.u .
this reference is called an idea of the end of the end of the code .
this idea is that every telephone society in europe , every internet service providers in europe , a bandwidth needs to store information .
who knows ? who ? who who is the email ?
who who who ?
and if you use a phone , where you are .
all of these information is going to be at least six months to two years from their phone company or their internet service providers .
and everywhere in europe , people have come up and said , " we don 't want . "
they said , we want to don 't want to the end user data .
we want to zoom in the digital age , and we don 't want the telephone companies and internet service all these information about us .
there were lawyers , journalists , journalists , priests , all said , " we don 't want . "
and here you can see how tens of thousands of people on the streets of berlin and said , " freedom rather than fear . "
and some even said this could be developed 2.0 .
the st elevation was the full of foreign policy in east .
and i 'm also wondering whether that really works .
can the really all this information about us ?
every time i use my phone ?
so i asked my phone company , the german fund , who was the biggest telephone company in germany , and i asked them , please ask me everybody that you 've been talking about me .
and i asked her once , and she didn 't get the right answer . just dumb .
but then i said to myself , i want to have this information because it 's my life , that your protocol .
so i decided to join them because i wanted this information .
but the german scholar said , no , we won 't give you information .
at the end it came to you with you .
i 'm going back to what they would send me information .
because in the meantime , the federal budget decided that the introduction of the e.u.u , the german line was in the law .
so i got this ugly brown paper with a cd .
and on the cdc was :
it 's a888 b.a.d.a.d.a.d.a.d.a.888 .
first , i first saw it , and i said to me , good , it 's a huge file . my own .
but then i realized after a while : that 's my life .
that 's six months of my life in this file .
so i was a bit skeptical , what should i start with it ?
because you see where i am , where i am at night , what i do .
but then i told myself , i want to go to the public .
i want to do it .
because i want to show people what 's going on climate data .
so together with time and open data city , i did this .
this is a visualization of six months of my life .
you can go out and get out , you can go back before and forth .
you can take every step i do , to track .
and you can even see how i 'm from frank with the train after kif , and how many calls i 'm going on .
all of this is possible information .
it 's a bit of fear .
but it 's not just about me .
it 's all of us .
first , it 's just so , i call my wife and she calls me , and we talk a few times .
and then i 'll just a few friends and they call them .
and after a while , they call them , and they call them , and we have this huge communications network .
but you can see how people communicate to each other , which time they call each other when they go to bed .
you can see everything .
you see the central figures , about who are the leaders of the group .
if you have access to that information , you can see what society makes .
if you have access to that information , you can control society .
this is a blueprint for countries like china and iran .
this is the perfect design of how to monitor a society , because you know who you 're talking to who knows who is an email , all that 's possible if you have access to that information .
and this information is going to at least six months , in europe to two years .
as i said to the beginning , we imagine that all these people in the streets of berlin in the fall of the fall of their pocket .
and the st elevation had known who was in the demonstration , and if the st elevation who had been the leaders who had been the leaders , that might never happen .
the case of the berlin wall may have not .
and also , not the case of the iron curtain .
because today , government agencies and companies want to store so many information as they can get over us , online and online .
you want to track the opportunity to track our lives , and they want it all the long .
but alien and a life in digital age are not a contradiction .
however , you have to fight today .
you have to fight for it every day .
so when you go home , they tell their friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century , and that 's not afashioned .
if you go home , they say your legacy , just because companies and national companies have the ability to store certain information , you don 't have long .
and if you don 't believe me , ask your phone company to the information you have over you .
so , in the future every time you use your cell phone , remember that they have to fight the digital age of the digital age .
thank you . thank you .
i live in south .
that 's south central : " flight muscle , fast , fast , break .
so the urban planner , and he started changing the name of south central to something else is , she changed him in south los angeles than if that changes something that goes wrong in the city wrong .
this is los angeles .
welcome , fast , fast , fast , broke down .
as 26 million other americans live in the food season , i live in the food desert island , the home of the back of the reserve and the " garden .
the funny thing is that the interface is more people are killing more than the interface .
people die in south central los angeles to cure conditions .
the obesity rate in my quarter is about five times higher than about beverly , which is about 15 kilometers away .
i couldn 't do that anymore .
and i wondered how you were to feel if you wouldn 't have access to healthy food if you go out every time you go out of the house , the negative impact that has the existing food system on her quarter .
i was hoping that bats bought bought and sold as use it .
i see , i look at the day-time centers like starbucks .
and i realized that this has to stop .
i met that the problem is the solution .
food is the problem and food is the solution .
and also , i didn 't have any more on the back-minute walk , to get a apple that 's not covered with pesticides .
so i 'm going to a food forest in front of my house .
it 's a piece of land that we call park .
it 's 45 feet .
the thing is , it 's the city .
you have to get it .
so i think , " cool . i can do what i want to do because it 's my responsibility , and i have to hold it into it . "
and i decided to hold it in stand .
so i came and my group , the l.a. green space , together , and we started to go to my food forest , and fruit trees , so the whole program , vegetables .
we 're kind of a series of investment group , pulled out of all social layers and out of all the city , it 's completely voluntary and everything we do is free .
and the garden is beautiful .
but then somebody .
the city came up to me , and he basically gave me a pre ago , and he said that i have to push my garden that has to become an judge .
and i thought , " come on ?
a judge of goods because of growing food on a piece of land that no matter ? "
and i thought , " cool . here . "
because this time it wouldn 't .
the l.a. times , wind got wind of it , steve l.org , made a story about it and talked to the city , and with a member of green , and they were a petition on ch.org.org , and we succeeded .
we kept the victory in the hands .
my town called even called it , and she said they support it and love what we do .
so , why shouldn 't you do that ?
l.a. has the united states most of the boundaries of the city .
you have 6 square miles away .
that 's 20 parks .
this is enough area to plant  ⁇ 2 million tomato tomatoes to plants .
why should you find this ok ?
you get 1,000 -- 10,000 seed -- 10,000 seed .
with green beans in the value of a dollar , you get fruit and vegetables in  ⁇ 5 dollars .
it 's my cure , i 'll tell people that they should be their own food .
his own food is like being to print to print .
see , i have a legacy in south central central central .
i grew up there . i have my sons there .
and i remember being part of this preconceived reality that was made by other people , and i 'm making my own reality .
see , i 'm an artist .
garden is my graffiti . i do my art .
just like a graffiti artist , the walls , the walls of the walls and park .
i use the garden , the earth , like a piece of stuff , and the plants and the trees are my heel for these stuff .
they 'd be surprised what can be anything if you use it as canvas .
you can 't imagine how amazing a sunflower is , and how you touch people .
what ? what ? what ?
i experienced my garden to a instrument for education and the transformation of my quarter .
to change the community , you have to change the composition of the soil .
we are the ground .
you would be wondering how children are influenced .
gardening is the most vulnerable and the most fundamental act you can do , especially in the city .
and then you get more .
i remember this time when this mother and her daughter , it was about 10 : 30 in my backyard , and i came out and looked like this .
i felt really bad because they were there , and i told them , " you know , you don 't have to do that .
the garden is not without reason for the road . "
i was scared when i saw people who were so close to me , and that 's just me to do that . people ask me , " fin , you have no fear that people steal your food . "
and i said , " to the devil , no , i 'm not fear that they are .
it 's the road .
that 's the idea .
i want you to take it , but at the same time , i want you back to your health . "
to another time , i put a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown in downtown .
these are the guys who helped me to get the truck .
it was cool , and they shared their stories about how it influenced it , and how they have with her mother and her grandmother and her grandmother , and it was great to see how it has changed when it might just wait for a moment .
you know , you 've already been about 20 gardens .
and to our way to come up to 50 people , and that 's all volunteers .
when children grow cotton , food , kids are employed .
if you 're tomato , eat , eat .
but if you don 't get anything about it , when they don 't show how to eat and bodies , they affect food , they 're blind , whatever you are .
i see young people who want to work , but they 're stuck in this thing -- i see colored children who are exactly on the path that you are for you , and it 's nowhere .
the gardening , i see as a chance where we can train these children to take care of their communities to lead a sustainable life .
and if we do that , who knows ?
we could make the next george washington car .
but if we don 't change the composition of the space , we 'll never do .
so this is one of my plans . i want to do .
i want to share a whole building block of plants where people can share food in the same block .
i want to take a ship captains and turn them into healthy cafe .
so , don 't understand me wrong .
i 'm not talking about free , because free is not sustainable .
the funny thing about sustainability is that you have to get through it .
i 'm talking about giving people work , and to get kids from the streets , and they bring joy to the pride and the honor and the honor , when you feed their own food , and when you open farmers .
so what i want to do here is to do this .

one of my favorite american dictionary in the entire oxford english dictionary is called " de facto . "
because it sounds so beautiful .
and " ethiopia 's " means " means " an even more democratic politicians . "
although in the 19th century , a newspaper , a better definition , " a snarab is someone who 's a foreign office , regardless of party , program , or editorial , and his success through the power of monument . "
i have no idea what language is " is . "
in words , i think .
but it 's very important that words in politics , and all politicians know that they have to try to control language .
in 1 ⁇ 1 , for example , according to the british parliament , newspapers , not the exact word of the debates .
and that actually went back to the courage of a man with the extraordinary names of the extraordinary names that started with the parliamentary elections .
they threw him in the tower of london and he was a , but he was brave enough , he was brave enough , and then he had so much support in london that he won .
and just a few years later , we find the first cases for the sentence as much as a lot of faith .
so , the way to the english word for machine .
but that 's not true . it 's going back to one of the press freedom .
but to show you how words and politics are , i want to take you to the u.s. , at the time when she just reached independence .
you looked at the question of how to george washington washington , the world war .
you didn 't .
how do you call the leader of a republic of a republic of nation ?
it 's been done in congress long period .
and there were all sorts of things .
i mean , some people wanted to call him governor , and others , his spark george washington washington , and again , others , of the freedom of the united states of america .
not as concrete .
some people just wanted to call him .
they thought that 's kind of thing .
they weren 't monia , they wanted to choose the king for a particular time .
it could have .
but everybody was upset , because these debate was three weeks .
i 've read the diary of a senator subject , which always writes , " still the same theme . "
the reason for the delay and the boredom was that the house was the senate .
the representatives didn 't want the fact that washington power is going to do it . they wanted to not .
king , call it , and it might even further ideas to its own .
they wanted to give him to the most interesting , most important titles , the most important title , who can give them .
this title was " president . "
president . they didn 't invented the title . he existed before , but he just meant that somebody who 's a meeting .
something like the front of a jury .
he didn 't have more size than the term " on " or " or " on the rubble . "
sometimes there were presidents , and government groups and government groups , but it was really a secular title .
that 's why the senate stopped it .
they said , " that 's ridiculous , you can 't call him president .
this guy must have to come and foreign fighters would meet .
who will take him seriously when he has a dumb title like president of america 's united states ? "
and after three weeks , the senate , the senate didn 't go .
you can learn three interesting things .
first -- and that 's what i find the best -- until now i can 't figure out whether the senate has ever been on the title of president .
barack obama , president obama , the title only title , he 's waiting for the senate .
secondly , you can learn that if a government says that something is a temporary -- then you 're 223 years later .
third , and that 's really important , that 's the most important point , is that the title of the united states of america today " not sound like this , or ?
that has to do something more than 5,000 nuclear nuclear warheads , who he has and the largest economy of the world and a fleet of the world and this stuff .
and reality and history gave the title of scale .
and so the senate at the end of the end .
you get a respectful title .
and the other concern of the seni , which is what 's going on , then it was that way .
but you know how many nations have a president ?
191 ⁇  .
because they all want to sound like the guy with the 5,000 nuclear warheads , etc .
so at the end of the senate , and the representatives lost house because no one feels when you 're told you 're now the president of america 's united states .
and that 's the most important thing you can take , and with which i 'll leave .
politicians are trying to use words to form reality and control reality , but actually the reality changes much more than words could ever change reality .
thank you .
so i came to a truck with about 50 rebels in fighting to go to dongguan , a 19-year-old , vegetarian of jacksonville , florida .
i put my black jelly beans 50th percentile against a few brown leather and fire was a rocket in the government that i couldn 't even see .
that was the first time i was in afghanistan .
for a long before i was faced with the war , but beside mrs.j.j.j. and football players at sam pot and unforg , which i knew about the north of afghanistan , and the italian , which i was going to come back with this communism and afghanistan . "
but that 's the geography of self .
and so i 'm here , sophisticated afghan afghan , south america , south america 's indigenous peoples , an atheist and a radical artist that lived the last nine years in afghanistan , worked and created .
so , there 's a lot of great things that you could do art , but i don 't like to paint , and i want to do art , the personalities and authority challenges and authority and authority and the reality and the reality , and even the reality of the world .
i want to spend a day in life of a jihad -- linear , who uses his jihad against feminists like " pop " pop " and religious practices and religious illiteracy to make political corruption .
and what else can do the jihad , as a department of parliament to make the parliament and make a choice campaign with the slogan : " i 'm doing jihad and i 'm rich . "
and try to use this campaign to spend these mafi , who spend as national accounting .
i want to go to afghanistan in afghanistan , with a project called " back-up " where you 're a policeman , a false control on the streets of kabul and cars , but instead of giving them money from them , and they 're going to take care of their names and name .
i 'd like to look at how conflict in afghanistan in my opinion , i 's become an urban conflict .
the war and the xenophobia who came with him , have created a new environment for st.c. and fashion that you can only create a fashion designer jeans for soldiers and suicide bombers , where i created the furers of people who are a couple of shelter or a couple of buildings .
and i 'd like to see how a simple set of kabul from kabul between 18999999 , to create a dialogue about how today 's developing newer their roots into walrus , and that the people have made a man to make a man .
but for all of these things you can come to jail , they can be misunderstood , you can be misunderstood .
but i do it because i have to , because the geography of self , it requires .
that 's my burden . what is your ?
thank you .
hi . my name is cameron russell , and i 've been working as a model .
for 10 years , precisely .
i feel that now , now , in the room , there 's a different context , because i didn 't have this dress .
fortunately , i 've been doing something about it .
this is the first time someone who comes to the ted stage , so you can appreciate that , i think .
if a few women were really upset , when i came out , you don 't need to tell me , which i 'll read later on twitter .
i also realize that i 'm pretty privileged , because i can change in a very short 10 seconds , which you think of me .
not everybody has the chance .
these abs are very uncomfortable , it 's good that i didn 't want to wear them .
the hardest part is to pull the sweater about my head , because then you 're all going to do , so they don 't do anything as long as he 's over my head .
right .
why did i do this now ?
that was .
well , it wasn 't so embarrassing as this picture .
an image is powerful , but an image is also is also also the surface .
i 've just changed their opinion of me in six seconds .
and on this picture -- i had never had a friend .
i felt very uncomfortable , and the photographer told me , i 've taken my back legs and with my hand into the hair .
and apart from surgeries or the wrong one that i 've been doing two days ago for work , there 's just very few opportunities to change our behavior , and our nature -- although it 's broken and uncharable -- big impact on our lives .
fearless to be called me to be honest today .
and i 'm standing on this stage , because i 'm a model .
i 'm standing on this stage because i 'm a lovely white woman , and in my industry we call this sexy girl .
i 'm going to ask the questions that people always ask me , but in the honest way .
the first question is , " how do you become a model ? "
i always say , " oh , i was discovered , " but that means nothing .
the real reason i became a model , is a profit in genetic lottery and an important legacy and perhaps ask yourself what this legacy is .
well , in the last few centuries , we have beauty not only healthy and young and young , based on which we are biodegradable , but also as big , feminist , feminist and bright .
this legacy was created for me . and it 's a legacy that was for me .
i know there 's people in the audience who are skeptical at this point , and maybe some fashion fashion designers : " wait , " stop . yo . yo napot . "
and first of all , i come to your model . very impressive .
but unfortunately , i 've got to tell you that in 200 ⁇  , a very ambitious graduate student of nyu 's nyu all the main thing on the course of every single one that has been turned out , and that from about 6 ⁇  percent or less than four percent .
the next question that always asks me is , " can i become a model when i 'm grown ? "
and first i said , " i don 't know , that 's not in my responsibility . "
but the second answer i really want to give this little girls is , " why ?
you know what ? you can get everything .
you can see the u.s. or the inventor of the next internet or a ninja-to-noxious , which would be completely ridiculous , because then you 're the first one . "
if you 're still saying this great way , " no , no , no , cameron , i want to become a model , " then i say , " my boss . "
because i have no responsibility for nothing and you could be the editors of the american bird 's or the ceo of h  ⁇  m  ⁇  m or the next steven .
to say that later you want to become a model , is as if you would say that you want to win the jack in the lottery .
you can 't affect it , and it 's fantastic and it 's not a career .
now i 'd like to show you 10 years to you about 10 years , because unlike heart disease can only do it now .
it looks something like this .
hopefully less than that in the middle .
that was -- i don 't know what happened .
if you finished school , and you 've done the school and a few jobs , you can 't say much more . if you say that you want to be the u.s. , but in the resume says , " 10 years old , " you get weird . "
the next question that often asked me is , " are all the photos ? "
and yeah , it 's pretty much images , but it 's just a small part of the happen .
this is the first picture i did , and that was also the first time that i wore a bung . i had not even been my period .
i know that 's going to be quite personally , but i was a young girl .
so i just looked a few months earlier , with my grandmother .
that 's the day of this day .
my friend 's friend .
that 's me on an example of a.j.d. , a few days ago in front of the french bird .
this is me with the football team and the v-day team .
and i am today .
and i hope you see that these images are not pictures of me .
it 's constructed and it 's constructed by a group of professionals , from haif , and makeup-to-up menu and photographers and photographers and all their assistants , and the companies and production and production . they build that . i 'm not me .
okay , next questions , people always ask me , " do you get stuff ? "
yeah , i have too many 20-story housing , which i can never wear , except , but the things i get free , are things that i get in real life and talk about it .
i grew up in cambridge , and one day i went to a store , and my money . and you gave me the dress for free .
when i went to my friend with my friend , a terrible driver , and they were over a red light , and of course we 've been stopped . it took only one : " sorry , mr. , " mr. , " and we could keep on .
i 've got these fiscal things because of my look , and not because of my personality and there are people who look for their appearance and not because of their personality pay a high price .
i live in new york and from the 140 million teenagers who were released over the last year , 85 percent black and latino men and latino young men .
it 's only 1 ⁇ ,000 young boy , male black male and latino , who doesn 't ask the question , " am i going to be ? "
but , " how often i 'm going to be ? when am i going to ? "
in my research for this talk , i found out that 53 percent of all 13-year-old girls in the united states , and that number goes up to  ⁇ 8 percent when they got 1 ⁇  .
the last question is , " how is it to be a model ? "
and i think you expect this answer , " if you 're a little thinner and a half hair , you feel very happy and beautiful . "
and then we give you an answer that might say this impression .
we say , " it 's really great to travel so much , and it 's great to work with creative , inspired people to work . "
everything is true , but it 's just half of the story , because what we never tell the camera , which i 've never told the camera is , " i feel unsure . "
and i feel unsure because i have to think about my mind .
and if you ever ask yourself , " would i be happier when i could have thin legs and shine hair ? "
then you should meet a few models , because they have the thin legs and the most fragile hair and the coolest hair and they 're the most part of their appearance , probably because of their most insecure women on the planet .
when i prepared this talk , it appeared to me very difficult to pull a honest way , because i felt very uncomfortable with me here , and say , " i got all the benefits of a pile that was made of my hand , " and it didn 't feel good . "
it was very difficult , a legacy of oppression because of gender and race , when i 'm one of the biggest reputation of it .
if you take a little bit of this talk , hopefully we 're all the power of the image of the image of the image of the image of the image and failure and failure .
thank you . thank you .
i 've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who 've ever forgotten in exile is , " son , the most respected residencies .
but i 'm never going to do something like a gaddafi revolution . "
it 's almost two years , since the libyan revolution has been inspired by the waves of mass media and both in the tunisian revolution .
i allies with a lot of other people , within the country to get a day of anger and to launch a revolution against the tyrant regime .
and there she was , a big revolution .
young women , women and men in the first row , the end of the regime , thought , the freedom of freedom , dignity of freedom , dignity , and social justice in the air .
they 've proved an example of courage by asking yourself against the brutal dictatorship .
you 've shown a strong sense of solidarity , from the distant east over the west , to the south .
finally , after a period of six months of war and almost 50,000 dead dead deaths , it allowed us to destroy our country and the tyrants .
but it 's got a big burden of a legacy , a legacy of the tyranny of corruption , the corruption and the basis for change .
over four decades , we 've been talking about four decades , both infrastructure and the cultural structure of the emerging society .
the devastation and the challenges of the challenges , i , as many other women to rebuild the civil society , and we asked a cofounder and fair transition and national income .
in almost 200 organizations , as and immediately after the case , we 've been founded in ben ali , almost 300 to three in three months .
after 33 years in exile , i came back to lydia , and with unique enthusiasm , i began to start the issues of human development , human development and leadership .
with a wonderful group of women , i founded the peace prize women , a movement of women , leaders from different lives , whose goal is to be public for the socialization of women and women , and for our right to our right-based democracy and democracy .
i met in a very difficult environment , a environment that was always more and stronger . a environment that was from the ego politics of dominance and different values .
i did an initiative of peace prize for peace corps women to reach a self-making choice , a law that doesn 't care about what the background , which should be right and choose to choose a political choice and everything to move to political rights and ask a woman between women and female lions .
at the end of our initiative and successful .
women raised 1 ⁇  percent of the national debt in the first elections for 52 years .
but slowly , certainly , the european union , the elections of elections , and the entire revolution after  ⁇  because every day we 're going to new news of violence .
a morning , we went to the mel gibson 's and sufi rituals .
another morning , we 're going to the murder of the american ambassador and attack on the message .
again , another morning , the subjects were sent by the army of the army .
and indeed , we are under the reign of milks and their operations against the human rights of human rights and their presence of rules and laws .
our society , shaped by a revolution of mind , polarities , polarities and moving from the ideal and principles of freedom , social justice , social justice  ⁇  that they first thought .
intolerance , from other people and revenge became the icons of the revolution .
i 'm not here today to inspire them to inspire the success story of our speakers and the elections .
in fact , i 'm here to tell you that as a nation , the wrong choices and the wrong decisions .
we have our priorities .
because elections didn 't get peace or security or security .
has the high-to-do list and the interplay between female and male peace and national reconciliation ?
no , that didn 't .
what ? what ?
why is our society is going to continue to continue to explore and driven by selfish politics and the dominance of the dominance , both men and women and women ?
maybe the women were not the only thing , but the female value of compassion , the grace of compassion , the grace and a fallacy .
our society needs a national dialogue and consensus and consensus than she 's needed the elections that only has the polarization and caused the polarization .
our society needs the qualitative embodiment of the female embodiment of female more than you need the numerical , more of the female male needs .
we need to stop in the name of the wrath of anger , and a day of revenge .
we need to start in the name of compassion and the grace to act .
we need to develop a female discourse that doesn 't just add value , but also about : government instead of revenge , instead of competition instead of competition instead of taking a different path .
these are the ideal that takes a war from the war , to reach peace .
because peace has a burglar , and in this al jazeera , it 's about the feminist manifesto and masquerading .
that 's the real deal .
and that 's what we need to do , before we do it .
after a verse from the koran " feminist " -- peace  ⁇  " is the word of god , god . "
the word " memory " again , " which is known in all abraham traditions , has the same arabic root like the word " " mother " and the mother 's mothers , " and the mothers , the whole of humanity that humanity and the female of the female and all the female .
and as the mother 's mother , the embryo that grows in it , completely is the basic reason of compassion .
that 's why we said , " my question all things . "
that 's why i said , " my story has saved my boss . "
let us all of the gs of grace will be done .
thank you .
when i was small , i thought my country was the best of the world , and i grew up with the song " nothing to call " on . "
and i was very proud .
in school , we 're going to tell the story of kimchi , but we didn 't learn much about the world out there except that america , south korea and japan are our enemies .
although i often asked myself , how the outside world is , i thought i would spend my entire life in north , to a whole point of change .
with seven years , i first saw a public sphere , but i thought my life was normal .
my family was not poor , and i had to have to suffer .
but in 1995 1995 , my mother brought a letter with the sister 's sister .
in it said , " if you do this , our five family members are not going to be in this world because we 've never eaten for two weeks since two weeks .
we are together on the ground and our bodies are so weak that we 're soon . "
i was so .
for the first time that people in my country .
shortly , i went to the station , and i looked at something that i can 't delete anymore from my memory .
a leymah woman stood on the ground , and a half-to-old kid in her arm , the face of his mother .
but no one helped them because everyone was so busy to take care of themselves and their families .
in the 1990s , there was a big famine in north korea .
at the end , more than a million north koreans of the famine victim , and many more damage , because they ate grass , and they ate tree .
rising and more and more and more and more and more and more , so that at night , all of it , except the lights of china on the other side of the shore , where we went to .
i always wondered why they had lights and we didn 't .
this is a satellite picture of north korea and his neighbors at night .
the river is the river , which is part of north korea and china .
as you can see , the flow can be very shallow , and it allows north america to the escape .
many die .
sometimes i looked at the river .
i can 't tell a lot about how i left north korea , but i can say that during the devastating years of famine years of famine after china was sent to china .
i just thought i would be a short period of my family would be separated .
i never thought it takes 14 years to rebuild again .
in china , it was very hard to live young girls without family .
i had no idea about how life would be as north america , but soon , i realized it 's not just extremely difficult , but also very dangerous . because north american refugees are being seen in china as illegal immigrants .
so i lived in fear that my true identity could fly , and you would go back into a terrible destiny after north korea .
one day , my greatest nightmare was true , when i was caught by the chinese police , and in the police department of the police officer ,
someone was to be north koreans , north koreans , so they took my chinese indian questions and asked me countless questions .
i had such fear , i thought i would explode .
if anything unnatural , i could be able to go and go .
i thought that would be the end of my life , but i managed to control my feelings and ask the questions .
after you were done with the search result , said , " that was a false memory .
she 's not a north koreans . "
and they let me . it was a miracle .
some north koreans , he was responding to china in foreign messages , but many are caught by the chinese police and abid .
these girls had lucky .
although they were caught , they ended up , they ended up due to massive international pressure .
these north koreans didn 't had so fortunate .
every year , there are many north koreans in china and north korea , where they are tortured , or publicly , or publicly .
even though i was fortunate enough , it 's a lot of other north koreans , not that way .
it 's tragic fact that north american folk tales have to fight their identity and struggle to survive .
after they 've learned a new language , and work , their world can be done in a moment .
so after 10 years of hiding , i decided to go to the south , and again , i started a new life .
i was in south , a bigger challenge , when i thought .
english was so important that i had to start learning to learn my third language .
i 've also found the big difference between north and south and south .
we 're all the koreans , but in the inside , we 've been very different , because of the 6 ⁇ 0,000 years .
i am a identity .
am i south america , or north america ?
where am i ? who am i ? who am i ?
suddenly there was no country that could have been my home .
although i didn 't even slightly cheated , i had a plan .
i was interested in university .
just as i was in my new life , i received a shock .
the north koreans called the money that i sent my family , and when my family was forced her family , on a remote place on the country .
so they had to be as fast as possible , so i began to plan .
north koreans need to have an incredible track back to the freedom .
it 's almost impossible to cross the border between north korea and south , and i took a flight back to china and made me to the north pole .
because my family has no chinese language , i had to join them more than 2,000 miles through china and then to southeast asia .
the bus ride took a week , and we 've been seen nearly many times .
once , when the bus came , a chinese police came in .
he took out of all and started asking questions .
because my family didn 't mind , i thought they would be arrested .
when the chinese family planning my family planning , i was determined , and he told him that they were chosen , and i was her mother .
he looked at me , but fortunately , he believed me .
we managed to go to lao border , but i almost had to spend all my money to bribe the border of la joos .
but even after we had the border , my family , because of long term .
after spending money and bribe , my family , my family within a month , but briefly , my family returned to the capital of la familia .
that was one of the biggest asset of my life .
i had done everything to get my family to freedom , and we were so close , but my family was arrested , just briefly , just before the south indian message .
i went down and forth between the immigration and the police department , trying to get my family , but i didn 't have enough money to pay for money or money .
i lost my lost .
there asked me the voice of a man , " what 's going ? "
i was completely surprised that a stranger worry about it .
in broken english and with a dictionary , i explained my situation and without hesitation , he went to a bank , and paid the money for my family and two other north koreans to get them out of prison .
i spoke to him from a heart of hearts and she said , " why help me ? "
" i don 't ask them , " he answered .
" i 'm going to the north american people . "
i realized that this was a symbol moment in my life .
and before the way , the stranger , a new hope for me , who needed the north koreans , and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community than the more hopeful community that need the north koreans .
finally , after our long journey , my family and i returned back into space , but freedom is only one step .
many north koreans are separated by their families and as soon as they go into a new country , they start with little or not money .
the international community can help us in education , the english language , education and more .
we can also be the bridge between the people in north korea and the outside world , because many of us still stay in contact with families , and we send them information and money that helps north korea from north korea .
i was so fortunate enough to get so much help and inspiration in my life that i want to be more hopeful north america , with international support .
i 'm sure you 're going to see a lot more successful north america all over the world , also on the stage of ted .
thank you .
i 've only one . please .
please tell me that i 'm normal .
i 'd like to introduce you my brothers .
remi is 22 , big , big , very high .
he can 't speak , but he 's doing joy in a way that some of the best speakers could not .
remi knows what love is .
he 'll split them , and he 'll split them .
he 's not greed . he doesn 't look at the skin .
he doesn 't care about religious differences and ask yourself : he 's never told a lie .
when he was songs from our childhood , when he was trying to look at words that haven 't even remember myself , he reminds me one thing : how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown unknowns .
samuel is 16 . he 's big . he 's very high .
he has an absolutely un-built memory .
but he also has a selectively .
he can 't remember if he stole my chocolate , but he remembered the published project of every song that we had , when he was four , while the first episode of the telecommunications of my arm , and he was four , while he was four , while he was the first episode of my arm .
do you mind ?
but a lot of people don ' voices .
and in fact , because you don 't understand the society of normal version of normal , they 're often gone through and wrong .
but what my heart failure and my soul has been proposed was that although this was the case , although they weren 't usually known as usual , this was only one means that they were extraordinary -- and extraordinary .
well , for those of you who are not familiar with the term " autism " ; it 's a complex function of the brain that are learning social learning , learning and sometimes skills .
it 's different from each individual different ways , so it 's so different than sam .
and worldwide , all 20 minutes in a new person , and even though there 's one of the fastest growing levels of the world , there 's no known cause or cure .
and i can 't remember the first time i 'm autism , but i can 't remember it without it .
i was just three years old when my brother was born , and i was so excited that i had a new creature in my life .
and after a few months , i realized he was different .
he 's a lot .
he didn 't want to play how the other babies did , and actually , he didn 't seem to be very interested in me .
remi and rainy in his own world , with his own rules , and he found joy in the smallest things like cars , cars in a row , the washing machine and eat everything he was under him .
and when he was older , it was different and the differences became more profound .
but behind the anger and the frustrated and the frustrated , and the never ended hyperactivity was something really unique : a pure and innocent nature , a young who saw the world without prejudice , a man who never had .
right .
well , i can 't deny that there were some challenging moments in my family , moments that i wish they were exactly like me .
but i go back to the thought of the things you taught me about individuality , communication and love , and i understand that these are things that i wouldn 't want to trade for normality .
normality , the beauty that give us differences , and the fact that we are different , doesn 't mean that one of us is wrong .
it means that there is another kind of right .
and if i could just say one thing , and to sam and to them , it would be that you don 't have to be normal .
you 're supposed to be .
because , or not , the differences that we have -- we have a gift -- everyone of us has a gift in , and in all honesty , the pursuit of normal potential .
the chance of scale , progress and change in the moment that we 're trying to be different .
please -- don 't tell me that i 'm normal .
thank you . thank you .
dodecahedron , we filled with awe and curious curiosity , with this photo on a project on a apple released through a apple and with a spiral time of only one millionth .
but now , 50 years later , we 're a million times faster and see the world not with a million or a billion , but a trillion images per second .
i 'm going to show you a new kind of photography that can create a new set of photography that 's so fast that it can create time of light into motion .
and with that , we can build cameras that look at the spectrum of our view of view , or without a x-rays in our bodies , and really ask ourselves what we do with " camera . "
now , if i take a laser beam and take it into a trillion second and turn it -- that 's multiple feet -- -- -- i create a package of photons that 's hardly a millimeter , and this photons , that project is done , and that 's going to turn out of light .
so if you take this project , this photons , this photons , and shoot it into this bottle , how are these photons in bottle ?
how does light looks like ?
so , this whole event --
so , think about it , the whole event actually takes less than a nanom -- so that 's the light to go back -- but i 'm looking at this video around 10 billion , so you can see the light into motion .
no , coca-cola didn 't solved this research .
so , in this film , a lot , so let me to analyze what happens .
the pulse , our project , our project goes into the bottle with a photons that starts to move around , and that ultimately breaks .
part of the light goes to the table , and you can see these issues .
many of the photons , ultimately , the following of the bottle and explode in different directions .
as you can see , there 's a air bubble around the bottle .
meanwhile , meanwhile , the waves on the table and because of the reflex of the top , you see that the reflex at the end of the bottle are focused on some images .
now , if you take a deep project , and let 's take the same route , and the video back to the 10 billion , you know how long you have to sit here to see the movie ?
a day , a week ? no , no , a year .
that would be a very boring film -- -- from a slow , normal , normal , in motion .
and what about something more alien-life ?
you can see again , you can see the table , the tombs and the wall in the background .
it 's like when you put a stone into a pond .
it appeared to me as if nature would paint a picture , a fick picture , but of course , our eye sees a solitary picture .
but if you look at these tom cruise again , you will see that when the light goes over the tom cruise , these farther away . it 's not dark .
why is that ? because the tom cruise is , and the light in her around and after several trillion seconds .
so , in the future , if this f-to-wire camera in your camera , it could be possible that you can go to a supermarket and see if a fertile , without even touching them .
so how did my team on this camera ?
so , when photographers know when you make a picture with a short time , they have very little light , but we 'll get a billion times faster than their shortest times , so you get as good as no light .
so what we 're doing is we send this project , this photons , this photons , millions of times , and then draw again with very clever samples , and we combine these gigawatts of data , we 're using this machine to make these fecal plumes that i showed you .
and we can take all these raw stuff and do very interesting things .
so superman can fly .
other heroes can be invisible , but how would it be with a new super-way design : to see corners ?
the idea is that we put a little light on the door .
it 's going to take off in the room , a part of it will return back to the door , and eventually we could take this more detail of light .
and that 's not science fiction . we actually built it .
on the left you see our f-pound camera camera .
behind the wall is a hidden , and we 'll let light on the door .
after we published in the " nature of coaxi " was published , " it was created by natural.com and they created this animation .
and because we have a camera that 's so fast -- our f-wire camera has some unique skills .
it has a very good time , and you can look at the world in light .
and so , of course , we know the remoteness to the door , but also the hidden objects , but we don 't know what point of distance .
by putting a laser beam , we can take a raw picture that -- as you see on the screen -- not really makes sense , but when we then turn many of these images , dozens of these images , and they try to analyze the different light , we can see that ?
can we see it in 3d ?
so this is our reconstructed .
we 've got a lot to do before we can make the laboratory into practice , we could build cars that are , and we can avoid what 's behind the curve , or we can look into dangerous predators , by looking at light , and we can look at the window , or we can look at .
but because of the dolphin , and tissue is , of course , which is really challenging to think of scientists now , now , because there 's a new picture that actually could solve the next generation of medical problems .
but it 's also happening here .
if you look at these waves under the bottles , you see that the waves are moving away from us .
the wave should move to us .
what ? what ?
it turns out that we 've seen almost into light , strange effects , and einstein 'd have seen this picture incredible .
the sequence of the events in the world , appear in the camera in the camera , so by using the more objective relationship between space and time , we can use these distortion .
it 's about time . thank you . thank you . thank you .
there are many ways of how our peers can improve our lives .
we don 't meet every neighbors on the street so many of these things don 't travel . but we use the same public space .
in the last few years , i 've been trying to share more with my neighbors and use things like stickers , and using chalk .
the projects came from my questions , how much rent my neighbors ?
how can we do more things without giving us to each other ?
how can we share our memories of the abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes better ?
and how can we share our hopes for vacant homes so that our communities need our needs and dreams ?
i live in new orleans and i love new orleans .
my soul is being rejected by the giant e.t. , who have been love for hundreds of years , drunk and drunk lines .
i think every time somebody never ever , there 's new orleans .
in this city , some of the most beautiful buildings in the world , but it 's also the city with most of the most distant reason in america .
i live near this house , and i 've been thinking about how i could do it , and i thought about something that has changed my life forever .
in 2009 , i lost somebody i loved ones i loved .
her name was joine , and she was like a mother for me , and her death came and unexpected .
i thought a lot about death , and i felt a great gratefulness for my life , and it brought me clarity about the things that are important in life now .
but it 's hard to me , this perspective every day .
it 's easy to lose in life and forgetting what 's really important .
with the help of old and new friends , i took a side of the house in a giant blackboard , and i wrote a giant floppy disks , " before i die , " i want to die , " everybody who can take over , a piece of chalk , and his life on this place .
i wasn 't sure what i was able to expect the experiment , but the next day , the wall was completely flat and it grew up .
i want to share some sentences with you who were written by the people who were written .
" before i die , i want to become a little bit , "
" before i die , i want to go through the international zone . "
" before i die , i want to sing for millions of people . "
" before i die , i want to plant a tree . "
" before i die , i want to call " web " life . "
" before i die , i want to leave you in my arms . "
" before i die , i want to be a cavalry . "
" before i die , i want to be myself . "
this was a meaningful place , and the hopes of people brought me to laugh , to cry and cry for me while the hard time .
it 's about knowing that you 're not alone .
it 's about understanding our neighbors and understanding in a new way .
it 's about creating space for thinking and to think and remember what we are most important as we grow and change .
i did this last year , and i got hundreds of passionate people who wanted to build a wall , so my colleagues and i built a building and i 've been building a building and now in countries like kazakhstan , south africa , australia , australia , argentina and other walls .
we have shown how much power our public places when we have the opportunity to share our voices and share more with others .
two of the most valuable things that we have are time and relationships to other people .
in a world with increasing distractions , it 's more important than ever before to look at things with the right view and thinking that life is short and sensitive .
we 'll often talk about death , or even thinking about thinking about death , but i realized that the preparation on death is one of the things that most of us .
the thought about death is the death of us .
our common places on the best thing that we are as individuals and community as a community , and with more opportunities to share our hopes and share stories , people can 't just help us to create better places , they can help us live better .
thank you . thank you .
thank you . thank you .
so , i 'm interacting with simple mathematics . a special problem for anyone who are engaged with a rational mathematics is that we are like companies .
nobody knows what we actually doing .
that 's why i 'm going to try to explain what i do .
dance is one of the most human activity .
we 're in the sight of the master 's search engine , as you 're going to see .
for the ballet , a tremendous amount of knowledge of knowledge and skills , and possibly a basic email that could have a genetic component .
sadly , sadly , neurological disorders like parkinson 's slowly cognitive ability , and that 's what she does in my known , who was a ballet of his time .
over the years , you 've done a lot of progress in treatment .
and yet there are six million people around the world that suffer from this disease , and they have to deal with the counter of weakness , like weakness , stiffness and other lives that causes this disease , and therefore we need objective resources to discover the disease before it is late .
we need to measure the whole thing , and ultimately , the only way to really know if there is healing , if we have an objective measure that question .
and it 's true that there 's parkinson 's disease and other movements , you can 't do a simple blood analysis -- the best thing that there is this 20-minute test .
you have to do it in the clinic . it 's very expensive , and that means that , outside clinical studies , never did .
but what if patients could do this test home ?
that would be a single tour in the hospital . what if patients could do this test ?
it wouldn 't be no expensive need to do .
it costs by the way , 300 percent to look at the neurological research .
and so i want to propose to you a different method that we 're trying to do that . because we 're all , in some sense , in some sense , in some sense , in some sense , like my famous dancer .
here you see a video of the vibrating strings .
that happens in healthy state , when someone comes out , we can look at as a coherent ballet , because we have to coordinate all of these coherent framework when we create sound , and we all have the genes for it .
and like ballet , it requires a lot of practice .
think about how long a child needs to talk until it learn .
through the loud , we can determine the position of the vibrating strings , and as the limbs are also influenced by parkinson 's disease .
on the bottom , you can see an example of irregular framework .
we always the same symptoms .
coherent , weakness , weakness .
the language becomes even more time , and it 's an example of it .
this impacts on the voice can be minimal , sometimes , but with digital microphones and precision-based software software , combined with new tests , which is now very advanced , we can now figure out where anyone lies between disease and human health .
how can these tests measure ? well , they 're both non-lethal act . the test .
little . the infrastructure is already there .
you don 't have to build new clinics for it .
and both are exactly . it 's not exactly what 's done .
so you can be done .
they 're very fast , take 30 seconds .
they 're very cheap and we know what that means .
if something extreme is extremely cheap , you can do it in a very large measure .
so these amazing goals we can do this now .
we can reduce logistical difficulty for patients .
patients don 't have to do anything in hospital .
we can be objective data through specific observation .
we can do experiments for clinical trial for clinical trials , and the first study of all the population .
we now have the opportunity to search for the first test for the disease before it 's too late .
today we 're doing the first step in this direction , we start the parkinson 's disease .
with acute myocardial infarction and patient treatments , we want to have a very high number of voices around the world to have enough data to achieve this goals .
we have a reputation that are a billion people on this planet .
everybody , with or without parkinson 's , cheap calls to leave photos for a few cents . i 'll give joy with joy that we already reached six percent of our goal in only eight hours .
thank you . thank you .
if you take samples , we say 10,000 people , you can say who is healthy and who isn 't ?
what are you going to do with all these specimens ?
what happens is that the patient 's patient 's patient has to be suffering from parkinson 's disease or not . ok .
some may not be able to the end .
but we collect a huge database , under different circumstances , which is interesting . these conditions are important , because we 're out of these features to figure out which are the actual markers for parkinson 's parkinson 's disease .
now , your 86 percent ?
it is much better .
my student 's -- i have to take it out because he 's done so fantastic work -- now it 's shown that it also works about the cell network , which allows this project , and we 're 99 percent accuracy .
i call a improvement .
that means that people can call -- people can call phone calls and do the test . people could call parkinson 's voice , so that your doctor can check the progress of disease .
right .
thank you very much .
thank you .
here i live . i live in kenya at the southern edge of nairobi .
in the background you see the cows of my father and the behind the cows is the nairobi park .
the nairobi- nairobi park is just in the south , and that means that the lost pit can leave the park anytime .
the predators , the lion , follow them , and then they do this .
they kill .
that 's one of our cows that was killed at night , and i woke them in the morning , and it was dead . it was terrible . it was our only one .
my tribe , the tribe of the masai , believes that we together with our animals and the pacific gyre from the sky , which is why our animals are so much .
as a child , i learned to hate .
our warrior hot hot plates . they protect our tribe and our blood . they are also because of this problem .
and killing the lion .
here is one of six lions that were killed in nairobi .
and i think there 's in nairobi national park , just so few lions .
in my tribe is a young between six and nine years for the cows of his father , so it also took me .
i had one solution .
my first idea was fire . fear is fear failure .
but then i realized that it wouldn 't really help us , but help the lion to see the cows better .
but i didn 't go . i continued continued .
i had a second idea . i tried it with a bird .
i wanted the lions thought , i thought next to the cow .
but lions are very smart animals .
you come to see the bird 's and go back again , but the next time you and say , this thing is not moving , that 's still here .
and they stop and kill our livestock .
one night , i ran up the barn . i walked around with a torch in hand around him and this time , the lions don 't stop .
lion is fear of light that moves .
i had one .
and as a young boy , i worked the whole day in my room , even the new radio of my mother 's mother 's day , and the day she nearly took me around . but i learned a lot about electronics .
i took a old automotive car , and i took a motorcycle out of a motorcycle . that shows whether you want right or left or left .
and i 'll take a switch to turn the lights and the lights .
this is a little birke out of a broken mess .
and then i built everything together .
the solar panel , the battery , the battery battery , which is the battery electricity at the air . i call it a transformation .
and the control rigging .
you can see that the birthing is looking for the outside , because of the lions come .
and this looks like the lion , if you come .
the lights and the lions believe that i go around the barn . i was the whole time in bed .
thank you . thank you .
i 've been doing this at home , and since we had no more problems with lions .
and then our neighbors of them .
one of them was this grandmother .
she had lost a lot of their animals , and she asked me if i could install the lights .
and i said , " yes . "
i put the lights . you can see the lions in the background .
since i 've been seven houses in the neighborhood , and they work really well .
my idea is now used in all of kenya , also for other predators like hyenas or leopard , the lights also serve to keep elephants from farms .
my invention of me to a scholarship to one of the best schools in kenya , brook internationally , and i 'm really excited .
my new school , and helps them through donations and enlightenment .
i even brought my friends with home , and we install the lights where there 's no one , and i show people how to use them .
a year ago , i just got a young boy from the savanna his father 's cows . i saw airplanes about me and said , " one day i 'm going to sit in a sit  ⁇  "
here i am here .
i had to do with a plane , for my first tedtalk .
if i 'm big , i want to engineer a plane , and that 's my big dream .
i used to collect lions . but through my invention , i can save the cows of my father 's father and the lions to that . we can live together with the side , with the lions , no argument .
ashok ⁇  oldenburg . in my language , that means , thank you very much .
you don 't know how exciting it is to hear a story .
so you 've got this scholarship . yes .
you 're going to other electrical inventions .
what is the next on the list ?
my next invention , well , i work on a electric fence . an electrical feature ?
yeah , i know , electrical fences are already invented , but i want to have my own .
you 've been trying to do it , not true -- yeah , i 've been trying to try again , but trying to go back because i got a blow .
the beginning is hard . richard , richard , you 're something very special .
we 're going to you in every step of your neighbor , my friend .
thank you . thank you . thank you . thank you .
since i 've been old enough to keep a camera in hand , photography is my passion , but today i want to share 15 of my favorite images ; and no one of them i did .
there was no way of directors , no sign , no chance to shoot a picture even . not even the lighting was destroyed .
to be honest , most of them were random tourists .
my story begins when i was a talk in new york , and my wife made this picture that i think of my daughter on my first birthday , we were at the corner of 5 ⁇  5 ⁇  5 and five .
and a year later , we were again in new york and so we decided to shoot the same picture again .
well , you can see what goes beyond ...
when the third birthday of my daughter said to my wife , " hey , why don 't you sabbatical after new york , and it 's a father-class trip to keep the ritual ? "
then we started asking people to ask a picture of us .
you know , it 's remarkable , how universal the gesture is if you 're completely strangers .
no one ever said no , and fortunately , we 're also never told anyone with our camera .
we didn 't know how much these travel would change our lives .
this journey is a journey has become us .
this was taken only weeks after september 11th , and i had to explain what happened on the day , so that a five-year-old can understand it .
these images are much more than just a single moment , or a certain journey .
they 're also a way for us for a week in october , time and about our time and how we 're changing from year , not just physically physically , but to reflect .
because although we 're doing the same picture , changes our perspective of time . while they 're still going to see new miles , i can see life with their eyes , as you interact with everything and how it looks .
this very intense time that we spend a little bit is something that we value and every year .
as a day , as one of our travel , we walked away , and suddenly she was standing on a red wine on a red wine on which she had learned as a little kid where earlier , earlier .
and she told me about their feelings that she had as a five-year period .
she said she remembered the heart of the breast , when she first saw the store for the first time .
and now you look up in new york to high schools because they wanted to study in new york .
and i realized , the most important thing we all create are memories .
and so i want to share with you the idea of sharing a active role in the mind of memories .
i don 't know how it looks at them , but apart from these 15 images , i 'm not on a family photograph .
i always am always the picture of power .
i 'd like to share every one of you today to come to the picture , and just don 't ask someone , " would you make a picture of us ? "
thank you .
